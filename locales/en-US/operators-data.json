Comms were cut off before Weiss could state the precise location, leaving Enciodes's guards no choice but to provisionally surround him. Shields and blades firm in hand, they noted, out of the corners of their eyes, the Caprinae woman standing by their master's side.\nThey were all sure that with this Caprinae bodyguard by his side, no attempt would ever succeed. They just needed to coordinate with each other and settle this chaos while keeping casualties to a minimum. Not to mention, Weiss managed to get the most critical part of the message out, so now all they had to do was wait patiently for the enemy to serve themselves up.\nBut they didn't get to await the enemy.\nIn fact, when they caught sight of the traps on the mountain that had taken down a dozen or so of said enemy, the guards, shields and blades and all, were momentarily shocked—just a few branches hidden in the snow, plus flint blades fashioned out of rocks struck together, formed traps no one would ever notice and yet which sunk circle after circle of blood into the white snow, a faintly sanguine pink even leeching into the tundra some meters out.\nAnd strewn all along the tundra were the enemy's now frozen severed limbs, as well as blood and pulped flesh hacked free from Weiss himself, forming mound upon mound in the snowfall. Sunk into the dismembered parts were wounds fierce, firm, and even visibly wrathful, while the cuts on Weiss that bared bone made every guard wince.\nItra do not reign supreme in sturdiness, and though Weiss's abilities excel, he is only human. Only a single member of Enciodes's guards, one who spends a considerable amount of time merely couriering Kjerag's letters to boot. People are fond of the faint scent on the letters he handles, and of his cheery face, and they admire his loyalty to Enciodes.\nBut no one would've imagined he had this side to him too.\nWhy? Nobody had asked Weiss to go so far. Being all on his own, simply passing on the word would've sufficed. He could've found somewhere to hide, and mustered enough defense to cope with this spate of traitors.\nEnciodes looks over Weiss, but makes no move to ask him anything. Weiss sorts out the letters and documents on the table and deferentially excuses himself. Before the door closes, Enciodes hears a cut-off remark vanish into the wind: '...live up to duty.'",

Cut up big pieces of food with your knife like this, stick your fork in, and you can put it in your mouth and eat it. You all got that?'\nIt's the young Zalaks' first time at the dinner table, learning how to use the tableware, and Hamelin is among them. She's never seen such sumptuous dishes before, their glistening sheen like flowing gold.\n'Hamelin, when I grow up, I'm gonna make sure we eat really tasty food like this every day!'\nHearing the voice beside her perk up, she turns to look and is met with her sweetheart's smile.\nMuch, much later, when she's long since left her tribe, left her beloved, Hamelin skulks alone in the dark. It's been so long she hasn't the energy left to recall the scene. Even filling her stomach is too much to ask now.\nAnother mission nobody else was willing to take. Her failing to contact her target the first time has lost her all her equipment, the only thing saving her life being the ditch she hid in. The aftermath of this mission failure will be hard to shoulder, but she's void of fighting capacity anyhow. Hamelin presses forward, limping against the damp brick wall, eyes sweeping over the putrid filth, searching for anything she can make use of. Eventually, in the thick of the mud, she catches sight of a portable dining set that's been thrown away.\nShe picks it up, wipes it off, hangs it on her waist, and then climbs out of the sewer, finding the restaurant where her target sits.\nIn the process of taking out her target, every item in the set finds its use: the bowl, the spoon, the fork, the knife, the canteen... In a first for her, she's done an efficient job, undetected by anyone. Hamelin exits the lavish, high-end restaurant, and wanders alone onto the streets. She feels famished, completely out of strength. Winding down, she slowly slumps against a wall, pulls in her knees, and buries her head deep.\n'Hello? You hungry? Want something to eat?'\nHamelin raises her head to find a large-tailed Lupo girl. The girl leads Hamelin back to her office, and places before her the remainders of her food supplies.\n'It's all we've got. Put something inside you, okay?'\nWatching Hamelin's movements, her brows suddenly knit.\n'Hey, don't use your hands—you're carrying tableware, aren't you? Are you not that good with it? Let me teach you.\n'Put your food in the bowl, then use that spoon to scoop up a mouthful. You can cut up big chunks of food with a knife, and stick it on your fork to eat it. Hand me your canteen—I'll fill you up some water.\n'If you go hungry again, you're free to stop by every day for something to eat... huh? What's wrong?'\nHamelin stares up, blinking frantically, refusing to let the tears fall from the corners of her eyes.",

If we hadn't been found by a Rhodes Island operator, Harmonia would be gone by now.'\nThe Feline sits down on a chair, and calmly regards the Vulpo.\n'I'm just so useless... Harmonia caught Oripathy because of me, and I can't even ease her pain...'\n'Not necessarily.'\n'Thank you, but you don't need to comfort me—'\n'That wasn't my intent. How did you have her take these remedies? Directly?'\n'I know a whole set of ways of processing herbs, but none of the finished products did anything at all.'\n'Try making some.'\nBlearily, the Vulpo lifts her head.\n'Try making some here. If you feel conditions are lacking, you may borrow a Rhodes Island pharmaceutical laboratory.'\n'N-No, that's fine, I can just make it here.'\n\nThe Vulpo blows her nose, and quickly enters work mode, using the herbal tools she carries with practiced hands.\nDry, chop, grind, soak, percolate.\nShe wastes no time at all. In a scant ten minutes, as exact as a machine, she has turned the herbal remedy into a sparkling liquid in a test tube.\n'What color is the liquid in the test tube?'\n'It's a very pretty green.'\n'Has the liquid you've extracted always been that color?'\n'I want to say yes, but also... I'm not sure. Harmonia was so sick, and I was in such a rush making so much per batch, I never stopped to note what color it was...\n'Make it again.'\nIn short order, herbal liquid fills a second test tube.\n'Keep making it, and do not stop. Continue until all the test tubes in front of you are filled with this medication.'\nFeeling gratitude to Rhodes Island, the Vulpo stifles the doubt in her heart, and busies herself as directed.\n\nThe sun falls past the horizon.\nShe is finally free to look at the results of her efforts, but the sight before her leaves her stupefied.\nThe medicines are all lined up in a row, every tube labeled with a time. The older they are, the more their color has deepened, first to as dark green as a forest, then finally to a complete black, as if a kind of grave hint.\nThe Feline stands up.\n'People wish to use medicine to extend the lives of others—an eternally praiseworthy effort. However, they always forget that the life of a drug is often far briefer than a human's.'\n'Keep in mind the brevity of life, and the Rhodes Island Medical Department will open its doors to you.'",

        "description": "A primer on receiving treatment, circulated in secret between Rhodes Island operators:\n...that case, you're in luck. He'll fix you up and be gentle about it.\nBut if your primary doctor is Gavial, I have one piece of advice for you: don't try and be smart with her, just do exactly as she says. If you've been treated by Gavial before, you know what I'm talking about, and I know you know.\nBut seeing as this primer is aimed at giving all you adorable, blank-slate newbies some advice from the deep end of the pool, I want you to read what follows very carefully.\nFirstly: no matter what rumors you've heard, don't be scared. Gavial is a professional medic who's qualified to practice. Her medical expertise is a genuine thing of envy aboard Rhodes. If she says she's going to treat you, but approaches you with tools that look extremely dangerous (including but not limited to hammers/drills/impact drivers), then stay where you are and do not move. There is a very high probability she IS coming to fix up your wounds. Of course, we can't rule out the scenario where she just seized a bunch of new toys from the enemy as spoils, and really wants to show them off to you, in which case you may express a suitable degree of admiration for her, BUT DO NOT GO TOO FAR, or she may beat you up.\nSecondly: please, follow her medical instructions to the letter, 100{'%'}. Don't complain no matter how bitter the medicine she made you take, because she means well. If she's laid down strict dietary restrictions for you, you obey them perfectly, unless you have miracle Arts that let you hide what you've been eating from everyone forever, which you don't. She's a good doctor who takes great responsibility for her patients, and if she finds you refusing to follow instructions, the consequences will likely be Very Bad. The Rhodes Island Medical Department does not accept complaints about that.\nLastly: when you're wounded on the battlefield and need emergency aid, please report in to Gavial ASAP. Otherwise, she may run out of anesthetics, in which case she's exceedingly likely to prep you for treatment using a technique she personally innovated and dubbed 'kinetic anesthesia.' It's been appraised by Medical as 'tentatively safe, but patient experience has been relatively poor.'\nThis author has been a casualty of said technique, and can VERY responsibly report there's a little more to the experience than 'relatively poor.'",

After the intense battle, everyone is visibly exhausted. She reminds her teammates to watch out for an ambush, but not a moment after she finishes—and before her teammates had time to react—the ambushers have already emerged from behind the boulders.\nThe very next moment, the fog that clouds the barrenland is immediately split asunder by the blinding flash of Originium Arts, forcing the ambushers to take a step back.\nIt seems casting the Arts was too much for Gitano to bear, giving her a spell of dizziness and a burning sensation at the source of her infection. 'You can't keep using your Originium Arts like that.' The advice she got from her tribespeople years ago echoes in her ear. 'Your body can't withstand it anymore. You'll fall ill if you keep casting them.'\nNonetheless, she has pushed herself to her limits in the tundra more times than she can count. With the responsibilities she shoulders, she's never been one to fear falling ill.\nSome time later, she faintly overhears two men talking in hushed voices.\n'Shh—It's okay. She fell asleep because she's tired. Her infection hasn't gotten worse. Don't worry.'\n'We have her to thank for reacting so quickly, otherwise we wouldn't have made it back in one piece.'\n'How did she foresee the ambush, though? If she's really able to peek into the future, wouldn't she also know that—'\n'Don't be stupid. She herself often says that destiny is something that can be changed.'\n'Will you really resist the guidance of fate itself?' All those years ago, her tribespeople implored her. 'We need to turn around. We don't want to leave our homeland, and we've already paid a dear price.'\nBut the young fortune teller kept leading them onward.\n\nThe Rhodes Island transport pulls out of the site with the team, after their successful rescue mission. The Elafia holds tightly onto her crystal ball as she sleeps on the stretcher. She dreams of the black forest back home and the bitter, salty snowdrops, as well as the silhouettes of the mountain chains peeking above the horizon. She's never turned around, nor can she ever go back.",

Only a few days you've been here, and you think that gives you the right to go sparring with that mouthy bastard lot? How many times have I told you, take things in order!' \n'Yes.' \n'Stand here! You're not to move from this spot until I say so!' \n'Yes.' \n...... \n'Why are you still here?' \n'You had me stand here as punishment...' \n'It's alright, you've been there long enough. That'll teach you, won't it?' \n'But it's only been five minu—' \n'Shut up, you little scamp. Any more lollygagging and there's no dinner tonight for you, got it?' \n'...Yes, Master.' \n'That's a bit more like it. Yes, have this biscuit. You must be starving, aren't you?' \nI shakily took it, but didn't dare put it near my mouth, fearing the master of the house would suddenly beat me, just as the villagers did. \n\n'I've seen the report. To do so finely on your first outing... not an easy feat.' \n'Thank you for the praise, hehe.' \n'Don't be so smiles and giggles with me. I still need to ask about something. After the assignment ended in Leithanien, you spent a while longer there. What was that about?' \nI heard some information pertaining to army mobilization on the border, and with the extra time I had, once I'd applied to the authorities, I went to investigate.' \n'Do you know how sensitive the Leithanian army's nose is?' \n'But...' \n'There are no buts! Even if they approved it, I permit you not to act without permission! If this happens again, I'll have you confined!' \n'Yes, Master.' \n'I'll forgive you this time. Even if you had the luck not to run up against the army, you must be covered in scrapes, aren't you? Take my card, and get to the hospital for a checkup! Now, immediately!' \nThe master of the house always had a volatile temper. Just as this time showed, if one thing didn't suit his mood, he'd yell his head off at me. \n\n'Master, look! I'm discharged and perfectly fine, aren't I?' \n'You think coming out of hospital's the end of it? Your assignment was to draw that Ursus spy out, and I could deal with him myself. Who asked you to block his blade in my place?' \n'It was an emergency...' \n'An emergency's no excuse either! I need to teach you a proper lesson, so this mess doesn't happen next time.' \n'How are you going to teach me my lesson, then?' \n'Erm...' \n'Have you decided?' \n'Hmph, you little scamp. You never listen to a thing I say.' \n'I've always felt I'm a very obedient one, though.' \n'...Right. Look at that old tat you're wearing. You're a fourth-order knight already. How can you be so neglectful of your own appearance?! This is your allowance for the month. Take it, and go buy some new clothes! You're not allowed back until you spend every last cent of it!' \n'Master, with this much money, do you want me to be buried alive under clothes?' \nThe master of the house awkwardly cleared his throat, quickened his step, and walked off before me. The setting sun spilled across his shoulders. \n\n'Come back to Kazimierz, should you want to come back. And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!' \n—This was the parting advice the master of the house gave to me. \nDoctor. I know you know, I was trafficked to Kazimierz before I could even remember. The village that bought me was end to end of hard servitude and beatings; even after I'd fled, I couldn't free myself from people who marked me with prices. \nBut the moment the master of the house and I met our eyes in the 'market'... \nThat was the first time fate showed me any kindness.",

The plastic imitation-tattoo one is her usual pick; it makes her neck look more slender. Most importantly, it's cheap—they come a literal dime a dozen.\n'Salary, y'know? I don't wanna splash salary. I have to rake that stuff in with my own poor cutesy hands.'\n'Rope, it's been ten minutes. Are you still not decided?'\n'Just gimme a tiny bit longer, pleaaase.'\n'I'm giving you ten more minutes. That's ten. Period.'\n'Gotcha!'\n'Man, I really like the other one too. Nawww. I super like it...'\nIn the box lies an exquisitely handmade leather choker, studded with limpid melee diamonds, somewhat at odds sat with the cheap and loud plastic product next to it.\nA few months ago, a fellow squad op gave Rope this choker as a present, as thanks for having her back in a desperate situation. Rope loves it. It's a treasure of hers, but never her pick. She used to loiter at the display window, making her reflection overlap with the pedestal behind the glass, and like moonlight shines on the water, this choker would sit around her neck. She'd flutter her eyes, and so would the girl in the glass, and in that moment they'd become one.\nBut unfortunately, reflections aren't forever.\n'I bet I looked way too desperate staring at it. I bet that's how she figured me out.'\n'Aw, it sucks so much. All the stuff I want but can't get, and now the only thing I get to do is daydream about it.'\n'Ugh—why'd I ever get on this pirate ship?!'\nShe dangles the choker in front of her nose, shuts her eyes and sniffs deeply at the leather's smoky scent. It's the fragrance of tar oil, picked up from its tanning phase.\n'Ahh, that's the smell of wealth—maybe I'll just wear this one for today. Then again, the leather's so soft. What if it gets scraped up?'\nRope cups the choker in her hands, and lightly rubs her cheeks against it, reveling in the sophisticated and sensual texture.\n'You're so comfy. I love you. Couldn't bear to wear you...'\n'It's been ten minutes! If you don't come out, I'm leaving you behind!'\nRope curls her lips, secretly showing her resentment at the voice nagging her from behind the door.\n'Coming!'\n'What are you even picking?'\n'I'm a girl going out! I've gotta pick out my shoes and outfit and jewelry just right.'\n'Your clothes look pretty much same as normal to me.'\n'You say that again and I'm gonna get mad.'\n'...Why aren't you wearing that choker I got you? Don't you like it?'\n'Of course I'm not. It's the good stuff. You've always gotta leave the good stuff for next time.'\n'Hrmph. I'd beg to differ.'",

She thinks to dig out some winter bamboo shoots to stave off her hunger, to take a few mouthfuls of snow to allay her thirst.\nThe bamboo forest is a fine place to hide, but she's not the only one who knows that. A dozen or so shinobi are in cover here, tasked with ensuring that this girl, the last survivor to escape from the purge of her family, does not remain so.\nThe bamboo leaves rustle, and the branches up high drift up and down in the wind.\nTheir tips shudder, shaking free small clumps of snow, which scatter in a slicing gust before they ever touch the ground, becoming a fine wintry mist and disappearing into the air. A few fowlbeasts on another stalk retract their necks, stuck out moments prior, and fold their wings up again, relaxing and continuing to huddle close.\nAll is still.\nThe bony girl lifts her head.\nSuddenly, a white glint.\nA dart at odds with her build flies from her hand, snowflakes and wind whirling alongside. This weapon has seen plenty of use thus far; now, it makes a clean cut yet smashes to pieces a bamboo leaf big enough to conceal someone.\nThe struck shinobi lets out a short cry, and powdery snow explodes off the layers of leaves. A trap prepared long in advance cuts off the girl's retreat. She leaps atop a branch, before being forced back by the flash of a descending blade. Her weakness from days without food catching up to her, she loses her grip on the branch, and drops like a stone. But undeterred, she looses one final arrow from her sleeve in midair.\nIt finds itself with no target to hit, but both her and the shinobi crash to the ground at practically the same time, with a dull thud. She lifts her head, and before her is a Lung dressed in black, brandishing a naginata right behind the shinobi.\n'So this is where you were, girl?'\nThe girl stares blankly, not knowing how to respond.\n'I am Fumizuki,' she says, patting the girl's head. 'Can you use a blade?'\nThe girl comes to her senses, and nods. She grasps a handful of snow from the ground, stuffs it in her mouth and swallows, draws a spare tantou from Fumizuki's waist, and charges at her enemy within the forest. Fumizuki watches this frail girl leave, and quickly follows behind.\nOne, then two. From sun overhead to horizon-laid, the shadows amidst the bamboo fall without even a chance to signal their backup. When the final shinobi uses the last of their strength to charge the girl, aiming a hidden shot straight at her stomach, Fumizuki pushes her down to avoid this fatal blow.\nOnce it's all over, a tiny body collapses in the great bamboo thicket, holding her wounds and letting out a long, slow breath.\nSunshine's rays filter through the leaves and shine on her face, the sound of fowlbeasts flapping by in her ears.\nBefore exhaustion brings her to sleep, her parents' lifelong teachings come back to her. The girl must offer her loyalty to the princess before her.",

The prey at her knees thrashes relentlessly and still draws ragged gasps, kiln-hot breath met with the ice-cold forest air as it flares from its nostrils, giving rise to a fine white mist.\nStooping low, she leans to its ear, and speaks a few soft words of comfort.\n'Shh, it'll be fine soon. Calm down, calm down.'\nHeeding her warm caress, the prey's struggles slowly cease, and it stares at her with its deep black gaze. In the pool of its stagnant eye, its pupil still tremors and quakes, stirring a whirlpool in its sclera, tenaciously seeking to draw one last drop of mercy from the two eyes staring back.\nYet her voice is a ruthless gust that coils through dead leaves.\n'It'll all be over soon.'\nWith a draw of a hunter's knife from her rear hip, slitting the prey's throat is both quick and clean. Fresh blood gushes from the incision and stains the earth, leaving behind a thick iron stench which mixes with the rotting autumn leaves and lingers for a good while in her nose.\nThis month shows signs of spring, winter having only just thawed, and the ice-littered creeks chill her fingers to a deep red swell while the blood hardened on the knife washes and melts away in the current. Like red threads needling through the water, flowing with the creek to the forest's edge.\nBehind her, a full beastskin hangs on a branch, with a bonfire lit below to cook the moisture from it. The prey's carcass has been split, one half skewered above the fire, wafting an enticing aroma of grease as it roasts. The other half she's left by the creek, soon to be found by scavenging animals following the scent of blood, and dragged away in their mouths.\nDaytime follows in the departing footsteps of night, early morn filtering through the forest in slanted beams from the east. Perfectly pale light glances again and again off the creek's shimmering waves, stabbing at her undefended eyes still adjusted to the earlier darkness. Her hand quickly shields them as she waits for them to adapt to the sun's sting. Warmth takes to the fine veins in her eyelids, inviting her to open her eyes again and see the beautiful sight. Letting out a deep sigh, she experimentally opens her tightly curled fingers. Her eyelashes tremble, she opens her eyes, and that which filters through the cracks between her fingers is the faint green of a rich forest. Deep in the trees, a kyebeast wanders through the cover, chewing leisurely at the grass, unaware that it's already been trapped in that frigid forest, and of the keen arrow nocked in a bow aimed at the hollow of its throat.",

Now my wish has finally come true. Do you know how happy that makes me?\nHere are some tactical gloves designed for Pioneer teams heading anywhere from Columbia to Sami, with insulating material, extra protection on the knuckles. They should do great for helping you resist the cold. I worried a lot about how they'd conduct Arts, but I don't really know much about controlling stuff as precisely as firing a gun, so maybe these gloves could interfere slightly? Whenever you reply, remember to fill me in on how they went in real combat. If you don't write me at least a full page, I'll tell Dad about how you've been ordering equipment from me on the down-low.\nYou mentioned how touching ice still makes you shake because of the brutally cold winter days you spent in Ursus, so none of the sugary stuff I'm buying you needs refrigerating. I hope this partner firm you're at now doesn't treat you too bad.\nYou always seem a little guilty about how you performed in your most recent op, like blaming yourself for not contributing enough. You might not be willing to tell me about what's happened in concrete, but I think if you're still standing on both feet at mission complete, nobody can ask you for anything more. You end up getting put through the wringer on campaigns as a merc, and even just listening to clients' stories tells me there's more than enough funny business out there. Even the most seasoned vets have some terrors carved into their memories forever, and some enemies they think they could never take down. I've even seen a guy start sobbing uncontrollably when something old came up at a meeting.\nIf you keep having all these nightmares, I just want you to know you're welcome back home anytime for some rest.\n—Take a step back, though. You chose to purchase new gear, and more etched ammo. Doesn't that say how brave you are?\n\nAlso, I'm not gonna jab at you about taking a break, but if you get hurt while wearing gear I designed, I'm gonna feel real bad about it. So get yourself in a good headspace before you run your next op, okay?",

It looks really cute.\nIt's leaping back and forth between the canvas and the paint every now and then.\nIt seems it's helping Deepcolor finish this painting.\n'So that's your assistant!'\nI can't help myself but to exclaim.\nShe nods.\nShe's smiling.\n......\nHow time flies; the painting has already been completed.\nShe hands the painting to me, and I pay her the commission we'd agreed upon.\n'You'll love this portrait for sure!'\nShe seems really happy.\nOf course, I am happy too. After all, what is there to be unhappy about when a painter hands you a freshly painted portrait, especially one so lifelike?\nThe colors are bright and vivid, and the expression is true and genuine.\nThis is magnificent!\nAs I mount the painting, a question suddenly comes to mind.\nThough it was on my mind just moments earlier, I immediately forgot about it when I laid my eyes on the painting.\n'Has she ever used any colors other than blue?'\n'Where did that discomforting noise come from?'\nWho cares?\nReally, who cares?!\nIt's not nice to pry into somebody else's secrets!\nEven if something might seem off, what does that have anything to do with me?'",

Also, would very much like approval for adding a music player.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Fernand II 3-wheel motorcycle, manufactured before Battle of the Four Emperors, antique. Mr. Greypaw conducted fullbody inspection, says original parts hard to find because of age. Re safety: vehicle as old as this should be in museum, not speeding on roads. Greypaw explained this to Earthspirit, Earthspirit stated vehicle originally belonged to mentor Prof. Bachmann. Earthspirit oft. sat in sidecar holding boxes of stones, following mentor everywhere on field investigations. Prof. Bachmann gifted vehicle to her at graduation, and asked her to keep a promise. At present, Prof. Bachmann is deceased. Left only this Fernand II behind, always reminding Earthspirit not to forget promise. Earthspirit rides this motorcycle on vacation, sidecar usually filled with various stones when she returns, plus other Catastrophe Messengers hitchhike on occasion.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nTO BE EXPENSED: Installation of suppressor for tuning fork\nJUSTIFICATION: Sound has been bothering people more lately. Seemingly caused by Oripathy? Require installing an inhibitor for my tuning fork.\nOVERVIEW FROM MEDICAL DEPT.: While true Earthspirit's Oripathy has grown severe, no others have heard this supposed sound she mentions. According to physical examination results, the worsening of Earthspirit's Oripathy seems to relate to her continued involuntary continuous usage of Originium Arts.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Tuning fork is Leithanian, custom-order by Earthspirit's mentor for Earthspirit. Rhodes Island requires relevant tech documentation before able to commence investigation of how to limit its output rate.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nLEAVE REQUESTED: Visiting home\nLEAVE PERIOD: Apr 1 TO Apr 8\nDATE OF REQUEST: Feb 24\nAPPLICANT: Glacier Wegenie\nDETAILS: Haven't returned home in a long time. I would like to visit, given relative proximity to Leithanien soon.\nVIEW OF HR DEPT.: Approved. Earthspirit was attacked by unknown assailants during a recent field mission, and is presently being treated in the Medical cabin. No adjustment of leave period required, as reconfirmed with Earthspirit. Additionally, Provence + Eyjafjalla will travel with Earthspirit, though given Provence has not returned aboard recently, we provisionally have not received her leave request.\n*Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.",

She has a decision to make.\n'You, take the beltway with your men. I'll take my team and make it through the city.'\n'Yes, sir.'\n'If we lose contact with each other, we'll prioritize the mission first. Make sure you do that. Got it?!'\n'Yes, sir!'\n'Roll out!'\n......\n'Dobermann, what should we do now?'\nDobermann and her team, having joined up with the resistance, have been retreating, but they find themselves being chased by pursuing enemies.\nShe must find a way to get her men out alive.\n'We can go this way... then take the waterway to make it past them.'\n'I'll need a few of you to stay behind, though...'\n'I'll do it. This is no problem for me!'\n'But...'\n'If I don't, all of us will die here, no?'\n'Sorry...'\n'This ain't your fault. You've done all you can.'\n'My brothers and I will get ourselves ready.'\n'I'm leaving everyone else to you!'\n......\n'Instructor, what should we do?'\nRhodes Island Operator Dobermann is currently carrying out a mission. The images she sees through her binoculars are once again forcing her to make a decision.\n'I think it'll be better if we lead the squad away and flank them.'\n'No, we'll wait till it's night where we are, then we'll head in through the ruins and attack that way. Our forces would be too divided, and that could lead to accidents.'\n'Understood.'\n'I'll head on inside first. Take the others to the objective point as soon as it gets dark and wait for my orders.'\n'That puts you in danger!'\n'This is the best way, and it's what I chose to do.'\n'I want all of you to trust in me, just like I trust you. Got it?!'\n'Yes, Instructor! Please be careful!'\n'Hmph, you just do what you are supposed to.'\n......\nThat night, Team Dobermann successfully completed its mission.'",

It is difficult to identify the age of an Oni, but she carries a bamboo naginata on her back, indicating that she is still a musha in training. Our florist has a secret rule: Oni are not allowed inside because their actions are uncouth, and if they are not careful, they will destroy months of the flower arrangers' efforts in the blink of an eye. We are justifiably cautious, as we never know if they might have the support of their kin from the underworld behind them.\nThere is an alley on the other side of the florist, and misbehaving students use it as a hideout. They demand money from their frail and weak classmates, throwing them to the ground or stomping on them. This Wednesday evening, I saw a little boy with a backpack run by the window with a sullen, tear-stained face and a bruised nose. On Thursday, he passed by this place with the Oni, but soon turned back alone and squirmed back into the alley. \n On Friday afternoon, I was helping the master arrange flowers when I saw people squatting along the side of the street with water pipes, wine bottles, crowbars, and the like. Before we could call the police, the person they were waiting for arrived. The Oni musha accompanied the little boy from school just like yesterday. When they got to our window, the little boy suddenly began to pick up his pace, and the teens who were bullying him quickly surrounded him. \nThey were almost ready to kill the Oni. The Oni's bamboo naginata managed to block a few blows, but was broken into several pieces by their sheer brute force. \nThen, that was the first time I saw an ‘Oni.’ \nThe Oni musha who had lost her weapon raised her fists, tearing through metal with her bare knuckles, smearing her own blood in the eyes of her opponents, lashing out with her knees and feet when her fists were blocked, striking out with her horns when her legs were restrained, biting with her teeth when her horns were blocked. When the whistle signaling the police's arrival came at last, only one was still standing – the Oni. \nShe wiped the corners of her bleeding lips emotionlessly, like the legendary man-eating fiends of lore. The people were intimidated by her silence and kept their distance to avoid her, pointing at her from behind windows and doors. \nThen, my master opened the door of the flower shop and walked out, sliding a bamboo leaf freshly-folded into an appropriate shape into the palm of her hand. \nThe young Oni warrior blinked, as if she had woken up from a nightmare, carefully closed her fist, and smiled at my master.",

Why's the sun a baseball, and why are all the clouds mitts? ...Before her sprawls the baseball field she knows so well, where she once swung her bat to her heart's content. Hmm? Someone's crying outside the field, and they've got crystals growing all over their chest, and their baseball got broke in half and they dropped it next to them.\nHello, why are you crying? Oh, I think I know you from somewhere? You're that ball player Ambrois Edwards, right? Look, I wrote your signature on my bat! But I guess I misspelled it as Edgards, heheh!\n...But he pays no attention to her, and continues to weep. The people on the field shoo them out, shouts of anger becoming baseballs pelted at them, striking against the Originium crystals on the player's body. He covers himself tightly with clothing, and gradually becomes a giant, solid, silent stone, losing all light.\nCuora puts her backpack on him, and tells the player she'll take him to Rhodes Island, where they'll be sure to turn him back to normal.\nThey climb over a hill of helmets stacked high, cross a bridge made of bats, ride a baseball through the sky—\nOnce the figure of the landship reveals itself before them, Cuora gleefully shouts, look! We're here! You can get treated here, and you won't need to be scared of getting chased off the field, and you won't have to use clothes to hide the rocks, and then they'll keep cheering your name in all cities everywhere—you're Ambrois the Invincible!\n...The player seems just as happy, and he emerges from the crumbling stone, and reaches an arm out, and waves a bat—\n\nPhew... hey! Who hit my head?!\nLava, lemme tell you about this really long dream I had! It was about... um, what was it about?\nWho cares! C'mon, the ball game's about to begin! And Mister Ambrois finally came out of retirement for this one!\n\n...In the Infected neighborhood, a few railings hem an empty lot, which the people have taken to calling a baseball field.\nCuora sees her idol. The freshly unretired player isn't hiding the crystals on his body, and the cheers drown out all other noise. She jumps and leaps in excitement.\nAbruptly, out on the field, Ambrois waves a hand at her, and steps out of the crowd to give her a light pat on the shoulders. Here in the sun, Cuora sees a smiling face.\nAt this moment, she recalls that kind of a long time ago, she was driven off the baseball field for her own Oripathy. That day, she wandered the streets from end to end, and ran across a weeping ball player.\nShe can't quite remember who it was. She can't quite remember what she said, either.\nBut the player before her right now says this to her: 'Thanks for those words of comfort you gave me, li'l missy.'",

She's going to put lots of sweet, sweet honey inside them, with extra jam and fresh, crunchy nuts. She's decided she's going to make them really big, and share them with all the people she loves. That way, everyone can eat to their heart's content, and every bite will be super sweet.\nWhat could possibly beat taking what you love, and sharing it with who you love?\n............\n'Let's get our stuff ready to move, Lada. It's gotten bad. We can't stay in the school any longer.'\nOn hearing what Sonya says as she enters the classroom, Lada hops to it without needing to think, following her leader with not a moment's hesitation.\n'Sure, I'll pack everything now.'\n'Hold on, Lada.' Anna, to her side, calls her to a halt and hands her half a honey spice cake. 'You should eat something too. Essentially all of the school's food has been torched. We're lucky you were concealing this spice cake in the first place...'\n'Hell of a big one, too! And sweet!'\nRosalind laughs boisterously from behind Sonya, followed by Natalya joining in the praise. 'Just a single bite silences the hunger. We were blessed to have you, Lada.'\n'Damn right,' Sonya nods, before furrowing her brow and addressing her directly, 'but you're barely eating anything. You've just been splitting with the rest of us. Didn't you share your cookies with some other guys too?'\nEat some more, Lada. They practically push the food into her hands.\nLada cups half a spice cake in her hands, not daring to blink, and turns to face away from the other girls in the room.\nThe Little Cub sniffles as quietly as she can, squeezing out the tears in her eyes and wiping them away. She presses her cracked lips together and lifts the spice cake up. She mimes a small biting motion, her teeth carefully shaving just a tiny bit from the top, the smallest possible bit of pastry and filling, and holds it in her mouth.\nSo sweet.\nHow can something be so sweet? She's never had a spice cake so delicious before.\n'Alright! I took a biiig, big bite!'\nLada turns back around, stuffing the spice cake into her bag and meeting the girls' concerned gazes with a smile.\n'It's true! I put lots and lots of honey in when I made it! Now I'm ready to go, I'm not hungry at all anymore!'\nAs long as she can be with the others, the Little Cub thinks to herself, no matter what she does, she won't have to suffer, or get tired, or fear anything ever again.",

        "description": "In the Snow Realm's coldest season, your mother fell from her burdenbeast in labor pains, where the thick snow cover protected you both. Her groans, each higher than the last, drew the livestock close one after another, forming a circle with her inside. Those livestock were warm of fur—so thick yet fine—keeping the blizzard away, and the hot breath from their mouths and noses became a wall, providing enough warmth for your mother's labor.\nYou were born, your face so filthy, and you bawled in tears. I put out my hand and caressed your eyelids, shut so firm, my rough skin brushing the corners of your eyes red. I was born with a pair of wide, rugged hands, in which your grandfather took pride, saying I would be a man who could feed his family, but that day they caused you to cry without end.\nThen your mother swatted away my hand in annoyance, and I laughed, about to pull my finger away, when your arm found its way out from your swaddle and gripped my finger tight. You see? You were only but the size of my hand, yet you made me panic like nothing else, and I stood there dumb in the snow, not moving a step.\nThe blizzard that had been screaming outside forced its way into this delivery circle the livestock formed, the red retreating from your skin, naked to the wind, and an ominous purple spreading over. Your mother opened the fore of my robe and pressed you against my bosom. Carefully and cautiously I wrapped it again, as if caring for my own second heart. And your face frozen frigid by the cold was warmed by my body, and finally you ceased to cry, and simply sucked your fingers and took small, weak breaths. Then your mother climbed onto my back, and called for the livestock to return home with a whistle. Their tumbling hides bounded across the gentle, narrow slope down the mountain, and I was like their leader, with her riding tenderly on my back, and you so frail against my chest, though my legs shivered as they sank into the ankle-deep snow. Like I was bearing the weight of all the land.\nThat robe later opened a hole right at its chest, which must have been from some Holy Hunt or other. Last year your mother unearthed it from our wardrobe's depths, where I had all but forgotten it. Your mother chose to repair it so finely it in the end, and asked if I would still wear it. I shook my head no, saying we would best send it to you. I'm well into my age now, and stoop more with each passing day, but you are in the prime of your youth, standing tall as the mountains, never to fear the north wind nor the icy snow. All else aside, I want you to have it. I imagine you'll look just the same as I did when you wear it, no? So wear it, and come drop by. My chest may be shriveled and dry now, and my robe run through with holes, but it's still far enough to keep a heart safe.\n—Letter from Father",

I've never heard it. I keep to myself, you know.'\n'What happened? Everything was normal, I was there at the counter spacing out. A little shop like ours doesn't do much business at three in the afternoon. Students are still in school, and the office types come by at noon to stretch their limbs for a bit before their bosses pull them back to work. I suppose officers like you on patrol mind our business now and again. Do you know Madame Oni? The tall, tall Inspector with a horn on her head? She and I—'\n'Black suits! Er, I was a little nervous, there must've been twenty in all. Us ordinary folks never see things like that. They were all rushing Miss Texas and that briefcase, and whatever they had in their hands, they were shiny and glinting! You see something like that for real, I dare say, and it makes those movies look like child's play! You know, Ah Sir, I'm a professional, I've seen every kung fu movie to ever come out in Lungmen, but the way Miss Texas squared up was completely different. She doesn't even seem that old. I don't dare imagine where she learned those insane moves, or how she got so trained.'\n'Right, the camera has me hiding under the counter, but I heard it all crystal clear! A dagger got sent flying and landed right next to me! Then a red-haired Sankta came in, I think probably to help Miss Texas, because I heard them say hi. She was called Exusiai? And then there was this whole massive rumble, that was something wild! I could feel my own liver shaking!'\n'Then it all died down, and I found the guts to come out from under the counter, and the black suits were all on the ground, and my shop was—ah, you don't have to worry about that, there were two big stars who came by later on. Miss Sora was one, and then the other was that rapping Liberi. They compensated me wonderfully, enough I could fix up my shop and open a cystybeast meatball stall.'\n'What about Texas? Er, she... she picked out some snacks after it went down and went to me to pay. It was the kind that's really popular with schoolkids, the biscuit sticks with the coating. She bought a whole handful of boxes. Chocolate, vanilla and the new salted one, and she bought a woven bag for a dollar too.'\n'What do you mean, I'm not telling you anything useful? You listen to me, that bag is designed by our shop! It's got cartoons on it!'\n'Alright, enough from me. Still, Ah Sir, there's one more thing—do you L.G.D. people know this Miss Texas? Tell her for me: the reward from her stamp card came in, a limited edition baseball cap, so if she can drop in when she's got the time...'\nNote by personnel on shift: Filed under Folder-Penguin Logistics 1097 (102), all charges on incident provisionally dropped.",

        "description": "Behind Zima's back, someone gently prods her with a finger.\nShe doesn't turn to look. She knows, instinctively, that it's Istina reminding her that her earphones are on too loud.\nZima likes to listen to music, and especially cherishes an electronic genre popular among the Ursus youth known as 'hardbass,' the pumping rhythm and heart-shaking bass of the tracks always fires her up, and her limbs can hardly resist the urge to fill with the beat—a desire to throw hands and feet and bust down the joyless everyday, an eagerness to free her tied-up mind always ready to color her soul.\nThere was a time where she'd sometimes wear earphones in battle too, grooving to the rhythm and stepping to the beat while cleaning up bandit nobodies.\nFollowing one training session, Dobermann sternly pointed out to her that 'as I see it, you're simply venting your violence.'\nZima sneered at that, and nothing more. Anyone could tell she wasn't the impulsive girl she seemed, for she could distinguish between people she could openly challenge verbally without fear of blowback—like the Doctor—and people who really cared about the rules, for whom rebellion was best kept internal.\nFor youth like her, knowing that distinction was one of the principles of survival.\nHer other instructor thought differently.\nNearl was by no means strict with Zima's attitude, but the Kazimierz knight's invulnerability and tacit, solid endurance left Zima frustrated and powerless.\nNearl even listened to a few of her favorite tracks and told her 'It's fine music. Very full of energy.'\nZima eyed her somewhat warily at that. 'You gonna lecture me or something?'\nThe knight of Kazimierz shook her head.\n'No. Whatever music you listen to, I have no objections.'\nThat was nice enough, but what came next was less pleasing to hear.\n'But you still lack the strength to allow yourself to be distracted in battle. If you wish to earn a passing grade from me, this won't do.'\nZima couldn't help but glare at her.\n'I will hold on to your player and earphones for now.' The knight of Kazimierz paid no mind to General Zima's fury; instead calmly speaking words she had never heard before, now even from her parents. 'Come now, no need for that frown. I'll spar with you using one hand; once you can best me like that, and are qualified to lead a team, I'll gift you a new set.'\n'Kazimierz's latest model. I've no doubt you'll like it.'\n'......'\nGeneral Zima traces her hand over the latest Kazimierzian communicator-slash-player on her wrist, without a word cutting off the music she had playing and switching it over to access her squad's comms channel.\nHer teammates chatter away, the mix of voices no less relaxed than the pumping hardbass rhythm.\nZima listens for a while, not realizing she's unconsciously moving her leg, tapping out a rhythm.\nIn her head now spins a rhythm more passionate, more fervent than her most beloved of tunes.\nAlright, Zima has to admit, she <<i>>does</i> like this new model a lot—\nShe's all fired up, and doesn't even need any music.",

I figured you'd rather improve its healing efficacy, or maybe durability.'\n'I probably would have thought along those lines in the past, yes.'\nMagallan doesn't say anything. She may spend her days in the tundra year in and year out, but that doesn't mean she's completely clueless about Rhine Lab's internal affairs.\n'I initially wanted nothing more than to be a researcher. I sought to thoroughly analyze the relationship between Originium and life, and I assumed I'd pry open the boundaries of knowledge with my own two hands.\n'But following a string of incidents, I could no longer ignore this: as long as my research doesn't change course, I will never be able to completely exclude the 'human' perspective.\n'Before I started a new job, I first needed to stand in the shoes of a doctor, from where I could examine my own dreams and ambitions. The most basic respect you can afford someone, as I see it.\n'Those drones, then, are the crystallization of my ideology.'\nThe two inadvertently share a glance towards the workshop. Mayer is inside racking her brains; entering hastily was very liable to get you bitten.\n'Speaking as a layman in medicine, I think these drones are already perfect as an extension of a doctor's hands.'\n'Perhaps, but I've increasingly come to realize that merely serving as a doctor... is still not enough.'\nSilence's expression is complicated. She lightly touches her hair.\n'Humans are far more complex than Originium.\n'We can roughly determine Originium activity from its surface appearance. We can predict the ETA of Catastrophes from natural phenomena. We can avoid infection through highly effective protective measures.\n'But how do we determine a person's interior life from what's visible to us? Do falling figures signify deterioration or improvement? Are people with crossbows ultimately there to defend, or to kill?'\n'Just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet,' Magallan murmurs to herself.\n'Yes, just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet.\n'Therefore, I need tougher measures, so that when the snowfield finally bares its fangs at me, I can protect the people I should be protecting.'",

Yes, not once.\nRhodes Island has confidence that we keep these samples safe under comprehensive surveillance, and it is only during treatment of disease that... what? Who's the supervisor of the bank?\nAhem. That would be Dr. Warfarin, one of Rhodes Island's most longstanding members.\nNo one could ever steal blood samples from under a Vampire's nose. I believe that it is precisely because Dr. Warfarin serves as its supervisor that we can confidently conclude that Rhodes Island's blood bank is not under any external threat.\n[Extract from Warfarin's diary]\nBlood tests on the new operators finished today. Haven't we had a few too many new ops lately? Feline, Perro, Liberi, Sarkaz... one lone doctor drawing all these vials from all these people... At first I was stirring a little at the scent, but by the end I was almost sick of the sight of it.\nKal'tsit really needs to laud me for my paranormal self-control. Forget all the young breeds running amok out there these days... Not even the old guard of our race could match my endurance.\n...Forget that, actually. Comparing yourself to them at anything is stupid.\nBack to the topic at hand. Collecting a few extra samples while I'm off the clock should be fine, right? That Skadi op, not to mention Specter and Gladiia... it's not every day we have so many gathered aboard. It's too good a chance to pass up!\nAlso, the Doctor.\nOh, the Doctor. Just a glance makes my researcher's heart tickle. It's so strange... where does that scent come from? Why am I so strongly drawn to it? Do other Vampires have the same reaction? Does Closure... Actually, never mind Closure. She's an exception.\nIf my judgment is correct, the Doctor's body should be hiding some kind of secret. I bet Kal'tsit knows it, but she keeps tight lips, and she wouldn't want anyone else to go digging.\nOh, that Kal'tsit! Kal'tsit! How can you dangle a chance to bare the truth in front of me like this, then forbid me from looking into it?\nCome to think of it, she seems less uptight lately.

She's here, waiting. \n\nFootstep noises. \nThe sound of boots treading on leaves. \nThe lone wolf patiently waits, until the prey has moved to the other side of her vision. Then like an apparition, she flits behind them, a cold glint in her hand. \nIn the next instant, the lone wolf's figure fades back into the night. \n\nThe visitor warily watches around, inspects their pocket, feels what they should between their fingers. They relax with a sigh, continue on, but are oblivious that the chip in their pocket has already changed homes. \nEven the counterfeit they feel now will, in a few short minutes, slip from their pocket, to disappear into the eddy of the woods' falling leaves. \n\nAfter all other breaths vanish, the lone wolf's figure emerges from the pile of withered leaves. \nThe true prey, the chip, securely lies deep in her knapsack. \nMission complete, the lone wolf sets back on foot, but her mood is by no means restful. \nDisconnected from her mission already, she's enveloped by the scent of the deserted overgrowth, and remembers Siracusa's wilds. \n\nShe walks alone, the past on her mind. \nThe wilds were drenched in blood. Grandma taught her how to get out of them, then straight away threw her into their midst. \nShe got out. \nShe exhausted a whole life's worth of possibilities at once, soaked in blood from head to toe, and finally got out. \nGrandma was very pleased, but as she expected, Grandma was no more than that either. \n\nShe got out of the wilds, and came headfirst into the maze, life's maze, far vaster than the wilds ever were. \nThe maze had uncountably many ways through, and Grandma never taught her a single one. \nSo she didn't know life's meaning, and she didn't want to either. She had no desire in her to learn, or to give it any trial and error. She just wanted the simplest way out of this whole maze— \nWithout Kal'tsit, she would be gone by now. \n\nKal'tsit said if you don't know where you can go, then stopping where you are, giving thought to the way forward, isn't necessarily a bad idea; during that time, she would be given shelter. \nShe listens to what Kal'tsit says. \nFor now, she stopped at a crossroads called Rhodes Island, and got food, a place to stay, and a salary she doesn't know the use of. She even got a small fluffy ball, stuffed in her knapsack, that she can hold in her hand when there's no Lupo's tail to stroke, letting her feel fur brushing past her fingertips. \nBut how long is she going to stay here? \nKal'tsit didn't say. \nBut she's ultimately unable to adapt to this tremendous maze, and the wilds stopped needing her long ago. \nSo, is she going to leave? \nShe doesn't know. \n\nThe dagger she knows lies deep in her knapsack, letting out a minute hum, just like a whimper.",

I've been having a few sudden, intense aches, I think the part where I got scratched hasn't healed normally. I've already taken stock of everything for today, and those people who didn't like me didn't follow as far as the store. No worries.\n\nA note stuck on the shabby bottle of perfume reads:\nThank you for always being with me all this time, and always being able to find me. This is a present for you. I know it's far from enough as a thank you, so if there's anything else I can do for you, please be sure to tell me right away.\nAlso, my sickness is mostly set to keep getting worse... If in time, this present can remind you of me every now and then, then I'm happy. It's alright if you can't remember me too.\n\nA note fallen in the market's grit paving reads:\nHello, do you need help sorting out goods or cleaning up dust? I can do other work too. I'd like to work in exchange for some food. You might not notice where I am, but please don't worry. I'll do everything as earnestly as possible.\n\nA note trapped beneath the dagger reads:\nMission complete.\n\nA note stuck in the corner of the bulletin board of a Rhodes Island lounge, almost covered by the neighboring rainbow of stickers reads:\nEveryone at the get-together sang very well. I didn't think it was one bit noisy. But if you decide to move to a more soundproofed room next time, could you put a notice up on the bulletin board beforehand?\nThank you to the person who recommended me drinks. I liked that sour and sweet dark orange one a lot.\n—Manticore",

Physically, mentally, in all sorts of senses... you conquer this height, you touch the sky, you prove your own worth.\nThat seems to be exactly it, yet it's not that simple.\nAt least, to Miss Ensia, it's not that simple.\nWhile in Kjerag, mountain-climbing to her was less about conquering something and more about connecting something. At the foot is her brother, Sir Enciodes, and the whole Silverash family, and atop the mountain is her sister, the Saintess of all Kjerag.\nShe's already scaled Karlan before, and whether to conquer or connect, she's succeeded.\nBut we've received word today that Miss Ensia has taken gold in a Bolívarian mountaineering event.\nAn honor she's put her life on the line for, with dangers beyond anyone's imagination.\nThe hosts' climate monitoring systems had malfunctioned, and the competitors were faced midway with a snowstorm and a series of ice cracks out of nowhere. With the vast majority having no way forward, the hosts announced the event was suspended, and organized a squad to rescue any competitors who hadn't yet returned to base camp. On top of that, Miss Ensia had lost her communications gear, insulated tent, and part of her food supply while escaping danger. In these extreme circumstances, every second longer out there was a matter of life or death, but she'd already overcome the most difficult, perilous ice ridge known to Terra, and the summit was calling. So, should she retreat, or should she turn around and continue up?\n......\nAfter Miss Ensia came to, the first thing she reportedly said to the medical personnel was this: 'The sight from the summit was amazing!'\nThe hosts proclaimed the event still valid, and gave the trophy to Miss Ensia, as the one and only award-winner.\nThe distant peaks beyond Kjerag have none of Kjeragandr's divine protection. Miss Ensia was no more than a competitor from strange parts. She succeeded in planting her flag at the very top, all just for a view of the unknown.\n......\nTo end today's special program, we leave you with a quote from the hosts' speech when they gave the award:\n'She is a true climber.'\n—Special report made on-the-spot by the network after news of Cliffheart winning a Bolívarian mountaineering event made its way back to Kjerag.

It's amazingly blunt. No lenscraft to speak of at all. Anyone can see how forced she is. After the commercial's over, whether anyone will remember the hair treatment cream is unknown, but the tail will have been undeniably close to perfection, soft and yielding with a gorgeous luster. Even the arc in which it pointed up, idyllic.\n\nProvence hasn't been a model before; she's only a Catastrophe Messenger. There's something she often hears, at least along the lines of it: 'if you can't do your best, you can only do better next time.' 'Better' signals something to compare to, and that signals regret. No one dares say whether the info one gets scrambling across and monitoring the wilds is 100{'%'} exact, whether you can get word of a Catastrophe to the epicenter in time, whether you can relay it to everyone there. Regret is part and parcel with a Catastrophe Messenger's work, and 'do better next time' is how they comfort each other. So when Provence had managed to shelter the villagers she'd just brought back from the barrens, and turned back to see a village lost under the violent storm, a village with people still into it, and she wasn't in time to save them, she could only tell herself: 'Don't blame yourself, Provence, settlements are too scattered in the wild, there's not even a comms line, you're doing this on just your own two legs, this was bound to happen... you can only do better next time.'\nThe next day, while she was resupplying at a town, she saw an engineering team. They were firm-hired, helping the local government install a local communications system, and they'd mounted electronic screens at some of the crossroads, so they could... put ads on them. Commercials worshipping quality of life bombarding people, one after another, while villagers in the wilds never even receive any life-or-death Catastrophe alert. Provence sought out the one in charge of the firm, and requested the local system extend its coverage out to the belt of surrounding wilderness. Even just a single emergency comms circuit more would do.\n'Those mucks are starving every day, and you think they can afford a hair treatment? How is this going to do anything for us?'\n'Don't give me that baloney about passing on hope. That's for you Catastrophe Messengers to worry about.'\n'Isn't there any way?' Provence knew this wouldn't work. She was just hung up on how if that emergency line existed, if things could be... that little bit faster in future. Of course she couldn't do her best, but she could do better, and 'better' signals something to compare to, and that signals there's a possibility, so it was down to her to do everything she could.\n'Did you just say your product was for hair treatment?'\n'Maybe—we can work together on this.'",

These past few days, dinner hours have ended with numerous operators unwilling to leave, sitting at already cleared-out tables looking around in anticipation of that day's confections.\nAn operator who wishes to remain unnamed (and is not a Lateran) confesses to us: 'I didn't believe them at first, when they said off-menu desserts kept showing up in the canteen recently. Then last night, my very idea of desserts got completely upended.'\nWe only half-believed it ourselves when we squeezed into the dessert section and pulled out what looked like an extremely ordinary 'lemon' from amidst the cakes. Not normally eaten whole, we cut the fruit open and got the familiar lemony scent, and even saw its glistening juices flow out from the cut. However, once we tasted the tart-yet-sweet, faintly milk-flavored layers of cake that made up the 'pulp' inside, like the other operators we were blown away by the chef's ingenuity and maestro-level craft.\nWe attempted to interview the few operators that typically make their way in and out of the cafeteria kitchen, but all of them smiled and refused to answer our questions. In the end, with Operator Ceobe serving as an avenue for our breakthrough, we finally obtained enough leads to discover the maker... no, the artist of these desserts.\nWe found the operator in question at the Medical Department. She was busy at the time, and could not spare us an interview.\nAs Operator Honeyberry (who just so happened to be free) informed us, the chef has recently been busy assisting Medical with developing pharmaceuticals more appealing to children.\nA significant number of child patients are aboard Rhodes Island, and the question of how to improve their compliance in taking medication has always vexed our medics. Many children instinctively make a show of resistance when faced with liquid or tablet doses that they hate the taste of. The vast majority of Medic operators can imagine that the simple addition of sugar wouldn't rid a drug of its strange flavor.\nAs of now, though, Medical has developed several successful formulations with this operator's help. Making use of her precise grasp on flavor and color, she's not only been able to conceal the uniquely offputting taste of these drugs, but has taken full advantage of the opportunity, using these medical flavors as a base to create aromas that make your mouth water. Following strict safety tests, these preparations have been provided to the children to immediately fantastic results. According to the little patients, taking medicine on time has suddenly become something to look forward to.\n(Underneath this news article is written in small font: She didn't want us to publish this draft out of shyness, and used more desserts to bribe us to that end... I mean, we couldn't not listen to her!)",

I've waited a whole year, and I've gotten really good with my crossbow! I can hit a tree branch from 200 meters away!' \n'Fine then, if you can go outside town, slay a gloompincer, and bring it back to camp before nightfall, I'll let you join.' \nThe squad captain couldn't talk the young girl out of it, so he wanted to make things as hard for her as possible so that she would reconsider. \nThough he had said those words half-jokingly, how could he possibly leave a child to fight against a gloompincer alone? He followed the girl quietly, curious as to what she planned to do. But when he saw her scouting out a sniping position, camouflaging into the environment, and then landing three clean shots in a row, he changed his mind. \nThe captain appeared in front of the girl as she dragged the corpse of the gloompincer back to town, the slain beast almost bigger than herself. \n'Come with me from now on.' \nThe girl lifted her head with a smile across her muddied face. \n\n'The Knight's Forest,' page 53. \nTime flies, and so the young girl grew up. She had fought in many battles against the Ursus Army, scoring success after success. The knights would come and go like the wind, routing the Ursus troops before disappearing without a trace. As their names spread fear through the ranks of the Ursus Army, the knights' prestige soared ever higher, and the girl herself became a war hero in the eyes of the people. \n'We won again. Why are you frowning?' The girl asked the captain. \n'Winter is almost here, and our supplies are running short. How long can we persist like this?' \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 137. \nThe fated day finally came. \nWhen the enemy army invaded, the knights prepared to sweep them with their usual hit-and-run tactics. But at that moment, the might of Ursus's artillery fell directly on top of them, and the knights were completely unable to put up a fight in the face of overwhelming military strength...... \n'Impossible! How could Ursus possibly know our precise location? It's utterly impossible, unless––' \nThe girl didn't have time for idle thoughts. The most important thing was to break free from the enemy's siege. If she died here, everything would've been for naught. \n'One day, I'll find you, whoever you are––' \nAgainst insurmountable odds, the girl somehow managed to escape the hail of bullets. Behind her... came the smoke of her hometown ablaze. \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 201. \nAll the pages of the book after this point were burnt, the edges of the leaf caught between the pages singed. \n\nThe leaf was laminated and stowed in the girls' tactical equipment box. Every time she put away her equipment, she would take another look at that leaf. \nThis may be the last leaf from her hometown that she can still see. \nThis is the story of an ancient war. Just another story. \nBut to Firewatch, this book – and the sole leaf remaining – seems to hold some deeper significance.",

The journey was estimated at five days, and on the evening of day 2, she picked up on another group of mercenaries targeting the caravan. In the dark, she readied her defenses. Early morning on day 3, she noticed the single mercenary squad tracking them had become two, and a plan to flee with her life began to form in her head. On the night of day 4, the two squads launched simultaneous raids, but took each other as enemies and initiated a firefight, in the end taking everyone down. No survivors.\n......\nID tag #10, code name 'Heavy Arrow'.\nThe mission: escort refugees to a neighboring town. Mixed in with them was likely a military spy, but that had nothing to do with her. All she had to do was hold off a different mercenary group who had come for their lives. Aiming to rescue a Sarkaz child who had drifted away from the group, she spent three days and nights in a confrontation with an enemy sniper, in the end shooting them dead. When she located their position, she found the sniper she had shot was a Sarkaz too—and not much older than the child she was saving. After that, she left Kazdel.\n......\nID tag #17, code name 'Meteorite'. The final tag.\nShe was hired by some organized militia in Kazimierz to take part in guerilla combat against the Ursus Army. Unlike her former missions, the guerilla squad was as close as family. They also didn't treat her in any particular way for being an outsider, a Sarkaz mercenary. She even made a friend among them. Never do good things last forever though, and due to a defector, the guerillas took a devastating attack. When she clawed her way out of that sea of flames by the skin of her teeth, she saw her friend at her side throw a disgusted, furious look her way.\n......\nAt present, this string of tags has been handed over to Rhodes Island along with a list of names. The 'Meteorite' tag is a very unusual one, with no blood type on it, nor any squad affiliation. Just the code name, engraved in its center. On the back, a phrase is etched in the Sarkaz language.\n'May the Sarkaz never suffer again.'",

So that was great.\nAfter setting foot on Sami soil, a Columbian graciously led her to her villa. Snow was falling on the plains, and across it quietly traveled a procession of people, the one at the head bearing flowers plucked from who-knows-where. They all silently followed him, walking towards the lakeside.\nAmongst them, a child slipped and fell to the ground, and Platinum helped them back up, petals falling into her palms as she did. Her mind flicked back to the past, when she was still an independent knight. To fans flocking to give her flowers—beautiful ones, fragrant ones, ones that seemed like they'd last forever. The flower-bearing procession was now some distance away when she had the sudden urge to see who they were giving them to.\nLooming by the lakeside was a deep white altar, all around which they laid the flowers.\n'They're honoring the memory of a deceased hero. The one leading 'em's a descendant. It's a custom of their tribe,' explained Platinum's Columbian hire.\nThey cast the flowers into the lake and began to dance, singing a nameless song whose melody was deep and somber, and they beat a flame alight. Some wept, while others spoke silently mouthed words, pure and reverent light flickering in their eyes.\nPlatinum and the Columbian watched from afar as they shared food around the bonfire, before they drew she herself in. Language failed to connect them, but mood did not, and there she tried a cup of local wine, and was given a red flower by an elderly woman.\n'Too noisy...' she thought. Soon after, the child who'd fallen over pulled her by the hand and merrily spun around, running as he did for the bonfire before bringing more food back.\nShe accepted his kindness, and watched the people before her.\nThe tribe raised the hero. The hero fought Ursus all his life, then died on the border. Countless descendants had come in his memory to tell her, a simple stranger, his story. The story of an escaped assassin, of what was hidden inside a meat pie cut open and swallowed by knife and fork, of a soft napkin wiping non-existent bloodstains and crumbs.\nThe lakeside was a distance from the plains, and the Columbian still stood wrapped in a blanket far away, illuminated by the villas' twinkling lights, waiting for Platinum to give the word to lead the way. Platinum stood by the bonfire, simply watching the people, never saying a word.",

Once evenly folded in, add the fowl yolk. Dice the dried berries finely (full chunks will be slightly sour). Sift in pastry flour, knead until smooth, then trim and cut into 4 x 4cm squares.\nNB: If these are for Sonya, make bigger. Natalya likes more salt in hers.

And I thought all along the chief would turn out to be the true mastermind! Now that I look back at previous descriptions, he did plenty that he wouldn't have done otherwise. Blatantly letting the protagonist go on with the investigation, making such a solemn vow at the meeting, and him and his wife truly being in love all along, not a political marriage... He even began by committing suicide...\nThe author's deliberately crafted narrative tricks may have had their impact, but I did still let first impressions blind me to many unusual details.\nIt may be that people truly can be affected by information from all sides given specific circumstances, and end up overlooking facts that should have been obvious.\nI've overlooked a lot, that much is true.\nThis is something I'll have to reflect on frequently in future.\n......\nI've borrowed several books from the Doctor throughout my time here at Rhodes Island. As a student, I've certainly been through things most others my age have not yet. It's beyond me to more deeply comprehend some conundrums posed in books with my current level of knowledge, but with my experiences, perhaps the author's intent is something I can feel out.\nPertinently, the passage on the 'mass' in Chashcha Lesa: 'Those who have done wrong once find they are not punished, for those around them who know of it will opt to turn one's blind eye to carry on living one's 'days of well-being,' so accordingly the wrongdoers will then go to do wrong a second and third time. May there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.'\nMay there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.\n\n—Excerpts from Istina's reading notes",

But other than that, it doesn't get in the way of my life, and can even help me in battle. Isn't that pretty decent? \nHmm, maybe that's what I'll tell the teacher’s pet the next time I see her. Can't wait to see what kind of face she makes. \nWonder how she'd even respond to that... \n'Your health isn't some kind of game!' \n'What's so decent about that? You're actually going to die!' \nSheesh, what's the big deal anyway? You only live once, right? So why not enjoy it? \n'Didn't you say you wanted to go traveling across the world? With Oripathy...' \n...... \n...... \nYeah, about that travel planner... \nI'm not gonna get to check off a lot of things from my bucket list. \nIt sucks that I didn't even make it through a tenth of my list before getting sick. And some of the places still on it don't welcome the Infected at all. The vast tundras of Ursus, Londinium's eclectic manors, Leithanien's concert halls, Kazimierz's knight tournament arenas, the thousands of fowlbeasts sweeping across Sargon's deserts... \nI wanted to see all of them, with her. \nMight as well cross them out now... \nJeez, why am I thinking about all these things anyway... It's all because of that teacher’s pet. I listen to her nagging too much. Even when she's not here, I hear her voice in my head. \nStop thinking about these things. \n...... \nLet's keep those plans after all. \nRhodes Island is still moving forward, so I have to keep moving forward. \nMaybe one day... \nJust maybe, those places will open their doors to welcome the Infected.",

Wei Yenwu did not appear, and merely sent someone to plant a new tree. She never hoped for Wei Yenwu's acknowledgement again.\n1st of January, heavy rain. On a New Year's visit, in the downpour, she saw an injustice on her way to the slums, struck out in anger, and took fifteen on her own. In this moment of mortality, she fled into the night by her hilted sword, harming seven, repulsing eight. When she landed atop, Wei Yenwu made a rare appearance, saw the sword marks, and gave her a single look before leaving.

She was high on spirit, believed she could hew away all injustice in the land.\n30th of July, cloudy.

Subsequently, in this moment of mortality, inspiration struck, Chi Xiao was unsheathed, and cut half a subterranean garage down. She sought Wei Yenwu to find out why Chi Xiao had and hadn't, but Wei Yenwu did not meet her.\n30th of September, clear. Chi Xiao was unsheathed a second time, cut open a treasury door, and saved the hostages within. She began to understand, Chi Xiao was a sword of will. She thought she had always done more than enough, but had in actuality done too little. She had to be faster, and mightier.\n7th of July, cloudy. On her birthday, over a decade coming, Wei Yenwu asked for the first time to see her swordplay. She condensed all she'd learned, and made an incomplete Cloudsplitter her final examination's answer. Wei Yenwu did not comment.\n1st of January, clear. Left Lungmen together with Rhodes Island. From here on forth, Chi Xiao will rarely be unsheathed.",

The coat of arms on her chest is completely scratched off, but the medic, who's trudged across more lands than most, can tell it is of Kazimierzian make.\n'Is your companion resting?' asks the knight softly, her voice filled with apology. 'It truly weighs on me that she should be so frail, yet use her Arts to rescue me. I hoped to be of service to you in some way, which is why I came back.'\n'Please, sit,' answers the medic.\n'No, allow me to be your sentry,' says the knight.\nHer hands grip her warhammer as she stands calm yet firm at five paces out. Her armor is speckled with blood, too; mere hours ago in these twilight wastes, she fought tooth and nail against mercenaries plundering a caravan, the radiance of her Arts nearly enough to convince one that the sun had risen anew. Now, those golden rays merely float about her weapon and body, indistinct. She professes herself to be Infected, afraid of neither the mercenaries' Oripathy, nor of giving her own life.\n'Do you still believe we shouldn't dissuade you?' asks the medic. 'Even though you know full well that despite felling a team of hired soldiers, the mercenary powers camped nearby will continue plundering wherever they please.'\nA lengthy silence. The knight turns her head. The slow rise and fall of the pale-white Sarkaz's chest as she holds her staff, her frail limbs pierced by fine and pointed Originium crystals.\n'I'm sorry, I simply... Perhaps I'm still not used to this.' Finally, she lowers her gaze. 'An insurmountable foe, incurably terminal... It wasn't you I was angry at, back then.'\nHer helpless indignation burns silently in the dark of night. The medic recognizes the naivety in those eyes, those familiar flames not knowing where to burn, that were inevitably snuffed out, one after another, in the misery of the battlefield.\n'I believe that... your willingness to act in defense of others, has sufficed.' She prods the bonfire with a branch, and speaks again with a nod to the knight. 'Please, come and sit. You won't wake up Liz.'",

Ugh... purse bleeding out. Heart too.\n7th\nShone the whole dang day, might of blown a thermometer, but they got this new flavor of pastry in at my favorite street stall. Lined up an hour and a half in the blazing sun, belly burnt red. Used some ointment from Sora and it worked real well, stopped hurting before I even went to bed.\n10th\nAll clouds. Purchased a new umbrella. Savings blown, be eating instant noodles all next month. Would of been frugal some the past few days if I knew. Got some left over for a rainy day anyway.\n17th\nCloudy but turned clear. Red-braised rib flavor instant noodles taste pretty dang good. Could eat for a whole week without getting sick!\n20th\nClear but turned cloudy. Ate all the red-braised rib ones, just tamagoyaki chive flavor left. It's fine, but I can barely get it down.\n23rd\nI'm all out of instant noodles... not one pot left. Thank all goodness for Texas sharing her cookies. Swear to my starving eyes, for an instant she had holy light beaming round her face.\n24th\nStorming!! Sunny like heaven when I got up. Pedestrians all walked by my umbrella stand, none of them turned an eye, all kept walking. But gloomy clouds rolled in and everyone got caught right out. Drenched to the bone! And I sold out of umbrellas basically instantly. Score!\nKiller profits like that don't grow on trees. Should save it at the bank, play the long game. Always had an idea tucked deep in my heart—get an emporium of my own, right here in Lungmen.\nMaybe time to get started on that. Little sum like this seems like nothing compared to the sky-high rent in Lungmen, but it's a solid start.\n31st\nNew combat boots out, my favorite brand. Shouldn't of done it. Act rash and now nothing but regret. Maybe... Should spend a night reflecting proper on my deeds. I must be a terrible sight when greed goes straight to my head. Life's tough...\n1st\nHey, new combat boots come in real handy! Might of hurt my heart to spend so much, but was worth it. Not a waste, not one bit!",

        "description": "Vina sits atop the roof, staring at the clouds above that hang ever crushingly low. It's a month in Londinium where rain comes every evening. Not too badly; it's a fine drizzle, nothing that inconveniences anyone rushing home from work, but it stirs the scent of the ground into the air. Rotting wood, the rankling smell of fins, and needless to say, sweat. The Borough of Norbert never smells much like a part of Londinium. All the bigger logistics warehouses have relocated to the north side, and the factories and markets have gone with, leaving behind a plate full of refuse no other borough wants, and the people with nowhere else to go.\nA shout comes from the boxing gym downstairs—sounds like Indra's won again. It's a night of celebration for the Glasgow Gang. Vina led the lot charging into the underground casino on Mariner Road this afternoon, and scared the Ronnie brothers right out of Norport wholesale. After that, the buildings surrounding were all Glasgow's. Morgan got all worked up and hefted barrels of booze over—needed to celebrate properly, according to her. Said she got this stuff from that top fancy pub on the corner, paid loads for it. Got Baird worried she'd been taken in. With enough drink down them, the lot all paraded up arm in arm and chanted her name, 'Siege,' so loud the whole street could hear.\nHow much of a conqueror does subduing a few gangs really make you? When she first got that name, Vina honestly could've laughed or died of embarrassment, maybe both. None of Indra's lot knew her background, and she wasn't even hiding it on purpose, she just never found the right time to share all. Norbert and Auchterigg were like two different countries—no one cared whose parents were who here. The most was the one time, when the police got hold of some Glasgow and brought them into the station. It was routine questioning from the coppers—what race was she? She stared that officer beaming from ear to ear dead in the eye, and on some ridiculous impulse, answered 'Aslan.' That threw him for a loop, and then he had her by the scruff, trying to tug her head into the table. Vina sat calm, didn't bend her neck one bit. Oh, he turned red. His hands shook and shook, as tends to happen on a diet of grease and drink, until he finally turned from trying violence to harsh words instead. Threatened her saying she wouldn't step out of this station for the rest of the month talking daft shit like that, the piddling hoodlum she was. She was out the next day. Morgan and Indra fetched her there, Indra telling her how she sent a Baron's boys running for the hills with a Molotov, Morgan saying she had to mediate like crazy, and it cost a pretty penny. Past the street corner, Vina couldn't help but take a look back. Absolutely nothing there watching her, no people nor giant creatures. That flash of gold must've just been the sun blinding her eyes.\nVina couldn't tell you how long she's gone without seeing Gawain now. Her teacher might well be everywhere at once. At a fried fin stand, mingling in the boxing gym, maybe up in the clouds above. Could be anywhere. The moment that occurs to her, something makes her twitch for no reason at all, and unconsciously, she goes to reach for another bitter lollipop to stick in her mouth. But once she does, she finds the metal box emptied. Completely vacant and light as a feather. Somehow, someway, her heart feels just as airy, like she's losing her balance. She'd better find something heavier to shove in there next time, Vina thinks. Wouldn't go wrong with some rivets from the construction site.\nSomewhere behind, Baird calls for her. Shoving her candy box back in her trouser pocket, Vina grins a little and turns around, sauntering back over to the clamor of voices that was, is, and will be Siege's.",

The father's daughter naturally inherits the ways in which he surpasses others, bloodlines ever able to record power and wisdom. So was the theory to which the Confessarii subscribed.\nThe daughter watched her mother intently. The white-haired Sarkaz woman shut her eyes and laid down upon her back. Her body rested in calm and grace, shadow cast upon the wall as if the very contours of love for her child.\nBelow her, an infant's silhouette was drawn out by the slanted moonlight, magnified, and finally thrown upon the wall as if some sort of monster. This newborn life was yet frail and impotent, but did not impulsively wail as the normal suckling would, instead silently opening its eyes that could not yet see. Then clouds masked the moonlight, and the mother's arms slid down past the bed.\nTogether with the light, the monster's silhouette did vanish from the wall.\nNow the daughter gazed, at this succession of life.\nIt was not her first time witnessing a life pass before her eyes. Her father had departed this coil not long prior, and now, another demise and nascence was playing out. The vanishing and parting, the swelling and birthing of life, every particular presented before the daughter, yet her Arts... the Arts of the Confessarii, would not stir at this, would not collect at her fingertips as expected.\nWhy?\nThe daughter was struck by confusion.\n'Life' was... the concept her father made occasional mention of, the subtle weapon held by the Confessarii, and the thing she was ever urged to gain comprehension of. But her father's death was an airy gossamer in her memories, of little thickness or weight; her mother's passing was all too abrupt, as if someone had with naked hands taken all vitality from her. Now, here in this dead of night, her brother had silently arrived.\nJust what was life?\nJust what was it she was feeling?\nDid the lives of those that populated the household—her mother and father that possessed the same silvery hair, herself who resembled her mother so, and this newborn brother who had yet to cry—did their lives resemble each other in any way?\n'Our lives, in the end, will become one with a higher form.' Such did the father tell the daughter before drawing his last breath.\nInstinctively, she had sensed it was no majestic metaphor.\nLife flowed in the veins of the family of the purest bloodline, and something returned to her side once again in this moment... Or perhaps, it had never left.",

Even if the lantern door is open, even if the light can bring warmth to others, the crystal itself is still fixed inside. \nIt is fixed there, because it has no ability to move on its own. \n'Nightingale, Nightingale––' \nI hope that one day, I will also be able to spread my wings and fly... just like the bird next to me. \n'Nightingale, wake up already––' \nUntil then, I must impose upon them yet more to take care of me. \n...... \n... \n \n'What's the matter, Shining?'",

An accident? Are you a Sarkaz now?!'\n'Alright, fine. Let's say that one's an accident. How do you explain the next one?'\n'It was you with the ammo dump at the shooting contest, no doubt about it!

Be honest and explain yourself!'\n'You managed to hit an ammo-carting burdenbeast, and it startled and ran back to the dump, you say?'\n'That... does... seem quite accidental...'\n'But you absolutely had intent in the classroom one.'\n'What flight of fancy drove you to place an explosive below the lectern? Wasn't that your favorite teacher?!'\n'What? You wanted to give her a nice surprise? Hah, a very nice surprise. The lectern blew up before she'd even come in.'\n'See? Your malice is... what?

From now on, I'm the one in charge of this school's... disciplinary issues.'\n'Don't give me all this rubbish, or I imagine you know full well what the consequences will be.'\n'What's this? What did you bring?'\n'A present? A model gun?'\n'Candy bullets?!'\n'Hmph. It seems you know a thing or two about my tastes. Excellent.'\n'I hope you'll remain this tactful on a permanent basis.'\n'You may go, Ms. Lemuel.'\n......\n'Are these really candy bullets?'\n'......'\n'Ooh, raspberry.

There was this Messenger who'd been sprinting to the wasteland settlement for nights on end, just to hand me a letter, so she wouldn't 'let down anyone's goodwill.'\nMaybe she noticed I was kind of out of my senses, because after I took the letter, she suddenly held her hand out at me, all serious.\n'...If you're feeling down, I have this trick to make someone relax for a little. Do you wanna give it a shot?'\nI was permanently conscious about contact after my whole Oripathy diagnosis, but she grabbed straight onto my arm.\nNext thing to hit me was how my own body had gotten lighter.\nSo light I almost couldn't feel its presence anymore, and so I couldn't feel the Originium in me either. There was light shining out of her staff, Arts glittering like fireflies and circling around us, fading in and out.\nThen I realized, we were fireflies floating in the air too. The land swayed away beneath our feet, and then I couldn't see my own shadow. All I saw was nomadic cityways stretching into the distance, the lights from all the settlements flickering like fireworks.\n'Light as a feather, right? All your worries and cares floating like dust now?'\nAlong the nomadic city streets far away, the lights strung together into lines, with the skyscrapers' shadows melting into the night. I used to hurry along their walls down in the street, and the buildings always stood there being so ice-cold and mighty, but now they seemed so insignificant, distant and innocent.\n'Deep breaths, in—out.'\nMy breathing fused with the wind. We peacefully floated in the night breeze, with the wasteland sand low below us, and all the stars in the sky felt within reach.\n'—Congratulations. You've blown the dust away,' I heard the Messenger airily say.",

The sender's face was sweet and brimmed with eagerness as she delivered it here, urging again and again to let her know straight away if there was a reply.\nAngelina gingerly left the letter on the recipient's windowsill, using a nice-looking stone to keep this kindness in place, so that it wouldn't be blown off next morning in the wind.\nHow would the recipient feel when they saw it? With a light heart, Angelina leapt down from the building.\n\nA very old box.\nSeemingly years and years old, its sender was an elderly Infected who lived in a wasteland settlement. Shaking, he wrote the address in one long string, crossing it out midway and changing it many a time, before finally, with a look of satisfaction, shutting his eyes. Quickly and nimbly, his fellow residents moved him somewhere far away, and so waited for his return to dust.\nAngelina found the address he had written, but the little cabin he'd reminisced about was no longer there. A splendorous new building stood in its place, and her gait came to a halt.\nWho did the old man want to send the box to? What was inside it? Angelina carefully placed it back into her bag, and knew she'd never know the answers to these questions now.\n\nA bag of vibrant green limes.\nAngelina had meticulously picked these fruits out at the stall, plucked off the dead leaves, wiped them clean of grime, and even sprinkled a few fine droplets over them. With no recipient, no address, and no sender, she followed her own memories and arrived in a familiar place.\nThe third house from the east end of the street.\nThe mailbox had previously received a letter with a heart drawn on it, but the husband and wife behind the door never saw the sender for themselves.\nStill, this morning, when they opened up at the knock of the door to find an veranda empty save for a few limes floating in midair, the couple knew their daughter had come by. They could've cried tears of joy, and perhaps they did.\nAngelina sprung out from behind the door, and gave them a great, big hug.",

I don't know what scripture was on his mind when he named it, or who he was thinking of, or what mistake, but I like the name. Hannya. I'll take it with me. From here on, it's my partner.\n\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nBefore I left, Hannya's good old 'father' said he had something else to give me. I thought it'd be something important, but it was just a hunk of scrap metal.\nHe said any handle paired with Hannya, I'd need to polish myself. It's a strange ask, but if that's part of the craft, it's not like I can't do it. Hannya already has a front that terrifies people, and an edge sharp enough to chop through enemies, so me personally making an inside to match might be the proper way.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nApparently, I've got to polish this to the point I can fight holding Hannya barehanded without chafing my hands, or feeling any sort of discomfort.\nAs in, I've just got to polish all the edges flat?\nAlright, looks like this is going to be a very long process.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI feel like I've been polishing for long enough, but it still chafes.\nIt looks smooth and flat already. Is this still not enough?\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nIt's been... some time since I left Higashi. Lungmen's a complex place. There's good parts, and bad parts. I've taught lessons to plenty who needed them, and run across plenty of interesting folk. I think I like it here.\nThere's no part of Hannya's handle for me to polish any further. After using it so long, even the curve's run flat. But it's still a metal block in the end, and no matter what, it won't reach the point where people can use it without any discomfort. It seems like it was all an impossible task from the beginning.\nI guess my craft isn't perfected enough. Even if I force myself to polish all the edges flat, it still can't hide itself. An iron chunk's an iron chunk, and it won't get any softer. Even if it looks smooth and slick, its nature won't change.\nAs of today, I think I've understood his intent a little.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI got this gift from my friends.\nMaybe it's bad of me to say this, but I definitely didn't expect those two ladies to put so much care into thinking up a suitable present for me. A latest-model soft-strap shield handle... it sure is something I've been in need of. I appreciate the consideration.\nYou know what they say about kind gestures from friends. Let's try using it tomorrow.",

That's not how this is supposed to work!'\n'It's the pursuit of wealth. Not uncommon.'\nThe towering Oni lady who responds leans behind a metal barrel, her posture somehow relaxed, but her hand never leaving her shield.\nThere's a momentary break in the commotion.\nHoshiguma takes a peek out. The other end is pitch black, and she knows danger hides in the dark.\nThe L.G.D.'s reinforcements are still out in the street, hemmed by a group of runaways who've broken the rules, their attack primed and imminent.\nThe situation is, in essence, a total crapshoot, and they can only wait for a chance to break the encirclement.\nAh Hsiang's face is grave. He was a street youth, no stranger to the downtown. He'd scraped through life for some years in every corner of the city, just a nameless nobody, but at least he had a talent for making it, or so he'd profess.\nNow he was an informant for the L.G.D., and at a glance much steadier on his feet. No need to lie—Hoshiguma was happy for that.\nIt's hard to tell who brought up the conversation up first.\n'How's everyone else been?'\n'Pretty good. Ah Sam's family found him a job. Daai Tau's running a bar now. I remember he was counting on you for the official stuff, Madame Oni.'\n'That's right. You? Haven't been back home all these years?'\n'No, too busy. Wouldn't work out.'\n'How's your family doing, then?'\n'Living on pensions. Not much, but they get by.'\n'That's good. Stable.'\n'You, Madame Oni?'\n'I'm cruising. If it's enough, it's enough for me.'\nAh Hsiang doesn't say any more. Neither does Hoshiguma.\nThe weather is gloomy, and it rained not long ago.\nFilthy, strangely-tinted water leaks out from the pile of trash bags next to them, trickling out near their feet and straight into a drain not far away.\nA rustling gradually abates. The calmer it gets, the more his nerves stretch.\nAt that moment, Ah Hsiang suddenly becomes talkative.\n'You afraid, Madame Oni?'\nHe asks, but he also keeps going. 'I only agreed to pitch in for the L.G.D. this time because you were here.'\n'There was that one time they said we could go out with knives to spook that shop guy for trying to snatch up business, and we'd get lai see for it. You still remember that, Madame Oni?'\nHoshiguma stares at the alley entrance, unnodding.\nShe remembers coming across those youngsters a few years ago. They were trash, dumped out onto the street, seen as scum unfit for society. They lived muddied lives, liable to drop dead for no reason, at any time.\nSo when Wei Yenwu invited her to join the L.G.D., Hoshiguma spent a whole night thinking, and then nodded to agree.\nShe believes there'll be change in Lungmen.\n'If you didn't stop me back then, I would've gone with them.'\nThe voice behind her trembles.\n'I heard, later, they actually killed someone, and they all got thrown in.\n'And there was the other time, those mafia guys from outside came giving us trouble, and in the end it was you who held them off too.'\nHis throat constricts, his teeth chatter, and his voice seems to falter somewhat.\n'I've been thinking. My family's toughing it a little, going on nothing but pension after all.\n'I bet you'd have an easy time charging out there if you wanted. If I wasn't here.\n'I took out insurance on myself, you know. I'm sorted.\n'So, Madame Oni, don't worry about me—'\n\nClank. \n\nA sudden brittle noise.\nLike some kind of signal, the L.G.D. Inspector rises like a sheer mountain, and breaks her silence with a roar of fury.\nAll hell breaks loose within that shortest of moments, set to the sound of trash being trampled, and piles of barrels being knocked over, and crossbows slicing the air, and—\nHefty crashes of metal.\nAn unblocked bolt pierces the Lungmen Guard Department Inspector's badge Hoshiguma has set on her chest, but it doesn't stop her shield sweeping through every foe as she stands in front of the one she's meant to protect, not one step forward, not one step back.\nHoshiguma once again lifts her shield, swallows a mouthful of blood back down, and coughs twice before finally saying something.\n'Not worrying about you'll be a little difficult.'\nShe wipes a bloodstain from the corner of her mouth, voice as though choking on water. 'Try something I <<i>>can</i> do instead—say, letting me apply for your bonus this operation. How's that?'",

        "description": "Saria stared at the old gloves before her.\nThey had originally been locked away in a closet in the Director of Defense's office, Rhine Lab HQ. Her departure had been too rushed to take nearly any personal items. And they should have cleaned out her office long ago. So why save these? Why send them to Rhodes Island? And why now?\nA few days ago, at the intervention of the Maylander Foundation, construction ceased on dozens of unlawful experiment sites. Certain people had bribed officials in the municipal planning department to circumvent the necessary auditing procedures, and used fabricated plans to deceive the ethics review committee. Business as usual. Saria had spent months on the move to find evidence of their illegal dealings—fortunately she'd gotten ahold of Anthony Simon, along with his sources. Ultimately, over half of the test sites shut down had belonged by Rhine Lab. Maybe that was why these boxing gloves turned up now. A warning, or even a reminder.\nThey were hardly the first boxing gloves she'd ever owned. Those would be the ones her father gave her, clearly unfit for a child, which always chafed her skin to the point of bleeding. But she persisted and did as her father told her, pounding her weakness into a sandbag, along with all her *impractical* emotions, punch by punch. Others had minds filled with openings, so one moment of complete disarray was all she needed to shatter their defensive line in a single punch. Saria was never as enamored with fighting as so many other boxers were: for her the skill was simply a means to survive until now.\nUnconsciously, her fingers read the ridged words along the back of the gloves. 'Trimounts Institute of Technology'—she'd once taken part in an intercollegiate tournament with these. She spent many a late night in the boxing club back then, always with a plus-one tagging along. That certain someone wasn't a fan of the sport, nor was she interested in the tournament, but hung around simply because 'varying your environment prevents your mind from getting stuck in certain lines of thought.' She wasn't joking: not much later she proposed the concept of a hand-mounted exoskeletal operating system, based on observation of Saria's own movements. That system was still in use to this day, in the office of Rhine Lab's Control.\nThough they hadn't seen use in so many years, the gloves looked as snug as ever. Saria very nearly put her hands in them, but a slight ache from beneath her shoulder blades held her back—apparently a call to adjust the dosage of her painkillers. The mercenaries outnumbered her in her last investigation, after all: a whole platoon against one .\nIt meant she was gradually getting close to the truth.\nA few minutes later, Saria let go of the gloves, stowing them in the lowest drawer of her temporary desk, and once again picked up Ifrit's latest physical report.",

Today, she's finally gotten an official assignment, doing something the mounted police should do—she's joining in the escort of a criminal.\n'Uhh! Not that I'm saying unlocking things isn't what a police officer should do... just...'\nIt's just that she finally gets to do something she's dreamt of since the beginning.\n\n'We've been attacked by an armed group, and we're low on heads! Division Three requesting backup!'\n'How are you, Division Two? Send two for emergency support! Hold on until HQ get here!'\n'It's Grani's team... She shouldn't be taking assignments like this...'\nThe fleet transporting the convict come to an emergency stop under the sudden attack, and though they're prepared for this, the numbers they're facing still exceed the mounted police's expectations.\nGrani holds a defensive posture behind the escort vehicles, the convict still inside, held by a teammate—they're not letting the door open again under any circumstances, as per code, so no worries about the subject.\nAfter that comes devoting everything to prolong the ceasefire as long as possible, waiting for support.\nBut her superior's words just now get Grani a little mad. She's heard words to that effect more than enough times, yes, but today's her first time on an official assignment, and she thought that was recognition of her ability.\n...Guess it wasn't.\n\n'All you need to do is stay here and defend the vehicle, and wait for us to sort this out.'\nGrani watches her two seniors run in armed against their fire, and they take down one, two... even more of the enemy appears from behind the bunker, shouting 'There's only two of them!' and rushing... her seniors and teammates suddenly fall, they pull their hands from the wounds they were clutching, and Grani sees palms red with blood.\nThe parked fleet creating its own highly useful bunker, Grani conceals within it and launches charge after charge. Her teammates have lost hope until they see her routing the enemy's formation, and they're hauled back into safety one after another by this pint-sized girl. The opposition so much as beats a retreat for the time being.\n\n......\nThe support squads following up take over the task of escorting the convict, and Grani keeps her injured seniors and teammates company on the way to a nearby hospital for treatment.\nBit by bit, she's been changing the way people see her, and though she's never rejected herself, getting the recognition of others is something that pleases her all the same.\nGrani dusts off the badge on her shoulder, a bit of ash stuck to it from the conflict before, and now it glimmers bright.",

A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths. \nSkadi does not resist. \nGradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases. The only information about her environment reaches her through the water's flow and echoed sounds. \nBut, it makes Skadi feel at ease. It is the environment she is most familiar with. When she goes on missions with her companions as an Abyssal Hunter, she slaughters the Seaborn in waters like these, and returns to that city sitting on the sea. \nBut right now, only icy water surrounds her. \nShe begins to feel lonely. \n...... \nShe is about to arrive at the sea floor, where an underwater city flickers into view. \nOnce upon a time, these Ægir technological marvels could illuminate the bottom. But in today's memories, this city-cluster still emits a radiant glow. \nBut... \nAt some point, the city became both distant and unfamiliar. \nSkadi belongs to the sea, but she does not belong there. \nShe falls onto the sea floor, motionless. \nShe is lonely. \n...... \nA song suddenly sounds out through the sea. \nA song of nature without words, without emotions. \nShe hears it. \nThe surrounding 'creatures' follow the sound and approach––\nThey grow more numerous. Yet more numerous. \nIn the Ægir's shattered light, they appear–– \nSea Terrors, Seaborn, and the unparalleled Behemoths of the sea. \nAlmost reflexively, Skadi stands up, the Ægir greatsword appearing in her hand. \nAfter grasping the current's flow around her, she charges at the swarm of monsters in front of her. Several vague shadows accompany her in her charge forward. They are clad in outfits similar to Skadi's, and wield Behemoth-slaying weapons. \nAt that moment, Skadi feels–– \nSnap! \nSkadi wakes up. She is lying on a bed, with medical equipment around her still running. \nA Rhodes Island psychiatric operator is staring at the readings on the device, the hand that had produced that snap still suspended in midair, the other hand continuing to jot down notes. \n'How do you feel right now, Operator Skadi?' \n'I feel–– \nVery good.'",

The air moist, too moist, so much so that it bears her with ease. A mere reach, a wave of the hand, and her body floats up, weightless. People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.\nSkadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.\nThe girl in red speaks. 'Are you a hunter?' she asks, voice ineffable and captivating.\n'Yes.'\n'Do you like to hunt?'\n'I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.'\n'To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?'\n'Possibly. Maybe.'\n'But then, why can we not all become kin?' the girl asks, sincere.\n'Is everyone kin, where you are?' Skadi replies.\nThe girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods.\n'We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.'\n'Then what do you normally do?'\n'I do nothing. I sing.'\n'It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.'\n'It is just as you see now.'\nThe girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance.\n'Goodbye. I have to go.' Skadi takes her sword and stands.\n'Are you going to hunt?'\n'I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.'\n'I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.'\n'If possible.'\n......\nWhen Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir. And like many other dreams, it became a fragment of a memory, buried deep in a corner of the waves of her mind. And when she dresses in that red dancer's dress in Sal Viento, that memory remains silent.\n'Now I look nothing like a hunter.' Skadi stares at herself in the mirror, murmuring.\n'Who are you, right now?'",

        "description": "'Swire, Senior Superintendent of the Lungmen Police Department, is off work today, so, just as always, she goes shopping at Paci Plaza.\nAfter a six-hour shopping spree across the entire mall, she is just getting ready to go home with eight big bags in her hands and a big smile on her face. That is, until she turns the corner to a Swire branded lipstick counter.\n'The usual. Five #38 Bullets. Thanks,' Swire masterfully asks the salesperson for her favorite lipstick.\nThe #38 Bullet has been her lipstick of choice for the past ten years. Naturally, the price is of no concern to her.\n'Of course, Miss Swire. Right away,' says the salesperson, who seems to be familiar with this process herself. She asks a coworker to take over at the counter and disappears into the storeroom to look for the lipsticks the princess personally requested. Before long, she returns with a wooden carton and hands it over to Swire.\n'Please confirm this is the correct amount.'\nWithout opening the box to check its contents, Swire merely acknowledges the salesperson and looks down to fish for something in her handbag.\nAfter a good while, she takes out a mini bag. To everyone else, this probably looks more like a petite handbag.\nShe unbuckles her bag, revealing five black velvet slots inside.\nIn each of those slots is a used up #38 Bullet lipstick.\nSwire removes her used lipsticks and places them on the counter before inserting four of her newly purchased lipsticks in the slots, with the fifth one going into her pocket instead.\nWhen she notices Swire placing her bags back on her shoulders again, the salesperson's heart begins to race.\n'Miss, would you like someone to help carry your bags?'\n'Oh? No need. They are hardly heavy at all.'\n'Frightfully sorry, but are you sure...?'\n'Yes, I'm sure,' Swire answers as she walks away from the counter. It seems she really needs no help with her bags.\nShe may not need any help, but there are others who need hers.\nNot a moment after she steps out of the shopping mall's front doors, Swire hears a loud scream for help. She turns to the scream's direction to find a thief dashing away with a woman's handbag in his hands.\nIt so happens she is running right toward a superintendent of the L.G.D.\n'What a coincidence,' Swire thinks to herself.\nBy chance, she does not have her flail with her.\nIt so happens she just bought new lipstick today.\nWhat's more, there is one right in her pocket right now.\nShe decides to teach the thief a lesson he will never forget.\nSwire sets her shopping bags down, takes out her lipstick and removes the cap, breaking the seal, and waits for the thief to come closer.\nA few seconds later, everyone in the vicinity hears a thud, followed by the thief's wail as he stumbles to the ground under the L.G.D. patrol officer's roar.\n\nSeveral minutes later...\n'Good work, Missy. You're off duty, and you still caught a thief for us.' Hoshiguma, here to oversee the arrest of the thief, forces a smile as she greets Swire, the brave good Samaritan.\nNormally, Swire would personally take the man in herself for interrogation.\nHowever, she has the day off. This case isn't hers to deal with.\n'This fellow has got to have some real rotten luck to run into me today.'\n'It's not every day someone bumps into an off duty inspector when they go to snatch something.'\n'Hmph, whatever. You take him in. I'm going home. I'll deal with the case tomorrow.'\n'If you say so, Missy.'\n'Before you go, I have a question for you.'\n'What is it?'\nSwire turns around to find Hoshiguma writing something on her case report.\n'What should I write for how the suspect was taken down?'\nSwire can tell that Hoshiguma is asking for her opinion.\n'Just write down that it was lipstick. There is no need to pull punches for someone like him.'\n'Ahaha, okay then,' says Hoshiguma as she cheerfully scribbles on her report, 'The suspect was taken down by lipstick.'\n'I don't even want to head straight home anymore. Why don't you hurry and finish up with work? We'll get dinner together.'\n'Would you like me to escort you home and carry your bags for you, Missy? Haha.'\n'Oh, enough questions. Hurry up already.'\n'Okay, give me a second. I'll give the report to somebody else, then we can get dinner.'\n'Be sure to tell me how amazing this lipstick of yours is.'\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Why don't you carry my bags for me now? My hands are getting sore.'\n'Okay, okay. Be right with you.'",

It has a nice sheen, the parts are brand new, and there's no rust or signs of wear whatsoever.\nThis is the first time that he's really owned something that's completely his, something so shiny from top to bottom. There is so much that Greyy wants to say welling up in his chest, but he's unable to muster even a single word.\nThat morning, the staff at Medical smiled as they handed him some documents to take to the Doctor's office.\nWhen he arrived with the big stack of papers, he ended up with a surprise present.\nHe hasn't had the time to process why he received this present, though—perhaps it's just psychological. He certainly feels his abilities still have much room for improvement, even if the staff he's been using is more than enough for all the Arts he knows.\nUnable to contain his excitement, he runs all the way up to the deck. The sky is so blue. The breeze blows past his hair, seeping into his throat.\nGreyy goes over everything he learned in his head. His buffs up his cheeks. His hands aren't trembling the slightest, even when he's holding onto the staff.\nThe Arts he learned from both his mother and the Rhodes Island instructors, as well as the knowledge he picked up while tending to the power facilities. He'll repay all this kindness in his own way—\nFrom freezing cold to blazing heat.\nFrom darkness to blinding light.\nHe gazes even further than his eyes can see, towards home.\nEven though he can't see any part of his homeland right now, he can feel the fragrance of it yet lingering in his nostrils. He even remembers how the abandoned Originium chunks felt when he touched them as a kid.\nHis light can now reach many more places, but the times when he sat with his father and mother in front of that small lamp are still some of the brightest memories he has.\nWhen the voltage of a staff's Arts Unit increases in an instant, the surge of the electric charges may as well be a reflection of the Caster's state of mind—From a state of disorder to one of order, they surge toward a common destination, in the end gathering in one spot and releasing a brilliant glow.\nOn the deck, the winds blowing from all directions brush his hair. With how vividly brilliant the sometimes introverted, timid boy looks this very moment, it's as though he himself, and not the staff, is letting out that radiant glow.",

The instant he turns to look in the voice's direction, he finds a crossbow bolt embedded deep into the soil, a mere inch from his feet.\n'S—Save me!' His legs go limp, and he falls to the ground.\n'If you really want to save your own life, then return what you stole.' Schwarz is stood on the rooftop, looking down on him coldly.\n'Oripathy put me out of work everywhere! I'll starve to death if I don't eat any longer!' Schwarz's eyes seem to pierce through him, and in a flash, anger overtakes him. 'You're Infected too, aren't you! Why can't you just let me go?!'\nSchwarz is silent for a moment, then gives a faint sigh. 'Because this is the only way you get to keep living. Also, if you can't find work, you can come to Rhodes Island. Give it a shot.'\nThe man is startled for a spell the moment his anger abates, already beginning to feel rueful. 'Really?' he asks, out of disbelief.\nSchwarz doesn't reply. She simply turns and leaves. She knows colleagues of hers will be there to help deal with his case.\nCome to Rhodes Island. Colleagues. She's reminded of when she'd just joined Rhodes Island, on the heels of a clash with certain others after having almost killed a target. It's almost hard for her to believe where she is now.\nRhodes Island's usual mission assignments are barely as complicated as she was braced for before she joined, but she hasn't missed people's whispers of what combat veterans like her have done before, and what they'll do again. She knows why she doesn't fall in their ranks—she joined Rhodes Island accompanying Lady Ceylon, and not out of any sort of personal belief.\nThe thing is—\nShe stops. Looks back. And sure enough, a fellow coworker is comforting the dejected youngster.\nAn Infected.\nFor the longest time, Lady Ceylon's dedication to curing Schwarz's Oripathy never really clicked with her, because she never felt her life was that important, nor did she think Oripathy was that exceptional.\nBut once she came to Rhodes Island, she realized how in a certain sense, she was honestly lucky. She'd never been treated unfairly for her own disease.\nBut no doubt, she was an Infected too.\nShe used to always accompany Lady Ceylon as she fumed, wait until she'd calmed down, and then brew her a cup of black tea. Lately, she's realized she sort of gets Lady Ceylon now.\n'Schwarz, did you catch the thief?' Just as she's barraging a local with geology questions, Ceylon sees Schwarz has come back, and waves excitedly at her.\nShe nods, and is there by Ceylon's side in just a few short leaps.\n'Schwarz, I've just heard about a group of homeless Infected banding together to attack passersby. I know we're in the field right now and it's beyond the mission's scope—could I leave it to you?'\n'Milady.'\nIt crosses her mind. Maybe I can do a little more.",

Are you still not going to kill me?!' He struggles to get back up, his shouts aimed at the one behind him, but his trembling tone bares his panic.\n'I haven't told you to stop yet. Keep moving forward.'\nIt surprises him—the answer he expects comes not from behind him, but from above.\nHe strains to look up, and the woman who gives him so much cause for fear is standing upon a thick tree trunk, the shade covering most of her face, leaving only a mouth pressed into a straight line.\nKachunk.\nHe knows. That's the sound of her loading a bolt into the groove.\nMore and more, his heart pounds like a drum, drowning out all sound in the forest, just like the thought screaming in his head louder than anything else.\nI want to live.\nHis hands push against the mud, and he throws himself out of the hole to lurch hurriedly forward, deeper into the forest. But death is tailing him, and can't be shaken. The woman looses the bowstring, and the bolt flies skimming over his scalp, leaving a wound down to the skull.\n'Aaagggh—!' he cries wretchedly into the sky.\n'Why? Why do you have to kill me?' The question is howled in misery, clutching his unstaunchable wound.\n'You're going the wrong way. You're meant to head right,' the woman icily orders, not answering his question.\nHis gasps come rapidly as he drags his staggering body in the direction the woman instructs. Very soon, he feels himself sunk still in the mire, ankles bound in place by some powerful force. The more he tries to step out, the deeper he's trapped. The mud gradually reaches his waist, and extends up towards his stomach.\n'Just do me a kindness, please, I'm begging you. I don't want to die here,' he finally croaks, unable to stifle the pain, realizing the dire situation he's facing.\nThe woman is not one bit moved from observing his twisted, shame-ridden face, and simply watches him thrash endlessly against the mud.\n'Three years ago, you ordered a group of completely unprotected child workers into a mine to excavate Originium. The vein was active, and caused an explosion in the tunnel, collapsing it. Every one of them was buried underground.\n'You must have been thinking that with such a terrifying accident, the children weren't likely to be alive, so you gave up on any rescue, and let them die on their own.\n'But there was one child, a very tough one, who used a razor to dig a tunnel to the surface with his own bare hands.\n'He dug for seven hours, without pause...'\n'I don't understand! What does that have to do with me?!' the man shouts, now breaking down.\n'Nothing. It just came to mind—I had a razor too when I was young. The only difference is, I wasn't digging dirt with it.'\nShe crouches down, and continues.\n'...I was slitting throats.\n'But there's not much difference. No matter how we used them, in the end we both relied on razors to survive.\n'Sir. I take it you're dead set on surviving too?'\nThe woman draws a hideously worn razor from her pocket, and throws it into the mire.\n'Then show me.'",

        "description": "Not one person could put words to her joy in that moment.\nWhen Glaucus gets her hands on this suit, she doesn't have any particularly great expectations. She imagines it'll just enable her to walk a bit faster, stand a bit longer, give her a few more days in her life of feeling the sensation of the ground with her own two legs.\nShe's not all too clear on what kind of change it can bring into her life, but she's sure it beats a wheelchair, and it'll give her a bare minimum sort of comfort during the times she can use it—she'd like to be able to stand as long as she wishes, after all.\nFraction by fraction, she installs the exoskeleton around her legs. The ice-cold metal presses against her skin, and the straps bind her weakened leg muscles tight. She gives lifting one leg a try, against the heavy frame has her all the more unable to move her feet.\nShe's spent so long unable to run now.\n'Is this really going to do anything?'\nGlaucus whispers to herself. She's not sure; she's never touched this sort of technology before.\nA few years ago, when Glaucus learned her leg muscle atrophy was caused by a hereditary disease in her family, she still had hopes she'd be lucky, thinking how maybe it could be cured, that it was only serious for a tiny fraction of her family, and she wouldn't be so unfortunate.\nYet as the days went by, Glaucus realized nothing could prevent the gradual loss of strength in her legs, and all she could do was talk herself into accepting this, how it was bound to happen to her body sooner or later.\nBut today, abruptly, with an unwavering power, the exoskeleton braces her body. Hurriedly, Glaucus seizes on this force and stands up, nervousness overcoming her, the bloodrush as her heart violently pounds causing her to take a tiny step forward.\nThen comes a second.\nA third.\nA fourth.\nGlaucus walks through the door, this physically choking emotion surging through her head, squeezing all her reason out. She has a sudden urge to run that defies everything. Even though she still hasn't gotten a hold of her balance, she feels she's gotten a miraculous hold of everything.\nThe metal is ice-cold, steel-solid, and it braces her frail legs. She runs like the wind, runs for the endless world outside.",

The student shuts her book.\n'—Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\n'Ceylon Doykos. Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\nThe three let out a collective sigh. 'See!' the student starts to tell the other woman in excitement. 'I'm fine, Professor!'\n'More like you're lucky,' the professor replies sternly, shaking her head.\n'I've warned you two before. Outdoor investigations are to be carried out within stipulated safe regions, during designated times, and proper protective measures have to be taken. Without specialized protective gear, coming into contact with highly activated Originium is exceedingly dangerous. Moreover, we have no right to extract ore from the mines. The mines can hold you liable for anything you've done. Ceylon, you're supposed to be a model student.'\n'But I want to verify the theories I see in my textbooks... and besides, if I hadn't warned Mr. Davis and the others to halt their work, there would've been an acute infection incident. I couldn't—'\n'What if you'd judged wrong?'\nCeylon stops in her tracks. After a moment, she droops her head. 'Sorry.'\n'I'm not expelling you, but you will have to retake this course,' says Ceylon's professor says as she gets up from the bench. 'It was only your first field outing. Be mindful of properly protecting yourself in future.'\n\nOnce the professor has left, only then does the mine-worker nervously move to say a word of thanks.\n'Thank you for saving us. I don't know if we've burdened you... Your professor sounds like she thinks you did the wrong thing.'\n'No, not at all,' Ceylon replies with a smile.\n'I know what my professor thinks. She just has to teach me these things as part of the course. I need to know fear, and the worst case, and I have to weigh whether the responsibility's something I can take.'\n'It's when I learn all that that I can truly make my own choices.'",

The professor and student mentors haven't shown any symptoms—which is to say, ordinary contact with an Infected, and even treatment of them, likely doesn't lead to infection at all.\nWhich lets me confirm that I was only infected because I made contact with Originium while it was in an active state.\nAs for the active Originium's origins: Was this region already polluted by Originium?—Unlikely, because the professor and student mentors weren't infected. Was it my contact with Infected blood?—Not impossible.\nI can be sure that Infected blood carries traces of active Originium. If so, I need to distinguish whether the areas I contacted at the time were open wounds, how long the contact lasted, the freshness of contacted blood, etc. For all factors.\nIf there was a wound, fresh blood was contacted, and contact was prolonged, I can hypothesize resultant infection was inevitable; if there was a wound, stale blood was contacted, and contact was brief, would infection occur? This can determine whether or not Originium activity in the blood of Infected wanes as time passes. Also, if there was no wound and fresh blood was contacted; if there was no wound, stale blood was contacted...\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the exact circumstances. Actually, I don't even know how I was infected. I was too busy...\nBut I do remember that before I discovered Originium crystals on my body, I had a fever, headaches, and other symptoms. Right, I was under the impression for a few days that I'd fallen ill from overwork. Now I see it must have been a sort of initial onset of the Oripathy infection. I often hear patients give similar accounts of their own circumstances during diagnosis.\nPlus, given a view informed by the critical care of Infected over the past days, my own condition is relatively mild, but I can't be sure of anything without further tests.\nThat's the best summary I can give for now. If I think of anything else later, I'll add it here.\nThe professor and mentors are staying here to continue their assignments. Aside from providing some practical accounts of Infected life from the perspective of a doctor, I'm not much help anymore. I'm currently searching for a medical organization that specializes in researching and treating Oripathy. As volunteers in the face of this still-unknown disease, we can't provide very effective care to those who need it most, and there may even be further infections down the line. We need more specialized, in-depth research before we can confront this sickness.\nWould such an organization exist?\n—Sussurro's diary entry following Oripathy diagnosis",

The life had already left his friend's body.\nAt the time, he didn't yet know that an unprecedented Great Rebellion was about to ignite war across Ursus, and this lost battle, coupled with the army's disobedience, was only the rebellion's mildest prelude.\nHe could only vaguely sense that, although the storm-in-a-teacup had already dissipated, an unusual calm still lingered.\nHellagur hung the scabbard on his waist and drew out the strange Higashinese sword. He examined it for a moment, but there were no familiar characters on the blade. He placed the sword on the table, presently covered with a battlefield map. The cold and slender blade lay vertically over the tangled front line, forming a large X on the map.\nHe opened the pocket watch to find a photo of a strange girl on the inside. She looked reticent, with only her eyes showing a liveliness and curiosity that matched her age.\nAt that moment, the girl walked out of the shadow in the corner of the command center.\nHer face, figure, clothing, and even the Originium crystal on her shoulder were identical to those in the photo.\nOnly her gaze was different from the one in the photo when she looked at Hellagur.\nThere was no curiosity, no panic, and even hostility seemed thin in her eyes. He could only detect calmness in them, as if her emotional quota had been exhausted by the war.\nHe tried to talk to her, showing her the photo in the watch, and even pointing to the sword on the table, but the girl just stared at him silently, in the same way he had stared at his friend's corpse in silence.\nHellagur realized that, like the sword, this was probably not the first time the girl had been entrusted to someone.\n\nShe suddenly snatched up the sword, which was even taller than her.\nShe held the blade and walked unsteadily towards him.\nThe tall Liberi didn't say anything. The way the girl held it didn't seem like she was preparing to strike.\nOf course, it was possible there were special Higashinese ways to wield the Higashinese sword, or maybe the girl was pretending to make an effort to hold the sword in a way that would keep the edge from being worn on the ground, and he was moments away from having the cold blade pressed against his throat.\nBut Hellagur didn't move.\n\nThe girl's wrist trembled, and she struggled to move to his side. She raised the sword up high, with the tip pointing at the ground.\nHe lowered his head and met the girl's gaze.\nShe seemed to be pleading for something.\nHe didn't know what she was asking for, but he nodded nonetheless.\nWhoosh.\nThe girl inserted the sword into the scabbard at Hellagur's waist.\nThen she spoke. Her command of the common tongue was tinged with a heavy Higashinese accent coupled with twisty Ursine intonation.\n'Don't drop Kudarikiri.'",

It's lifted by a crude pole stuck into the earth, wind sweeping up sand and flying the banner straight.\nA passerby sees the design upon it and is struck by vague familiarity, but where he's seen it before totally escapes him. A cloth with the same design covers the grain pile back at his home, dust having long worn that special symbol away.\nHe sees the towering flag and pulls out his hatchet, thinking to cut the flagpole down. The fabric seems sturdy and strong, the pole suitable for firewood. Unwanted by anyone, he may as well chop it down and put it to better use. Just like how every settlement in this stretch of the wild fights one another over soil and resources, ultimately evolving into ever more brand-new civilizations.\nThe axe hacks into the pole, but cannot cut it. He puts a hand out to shake it, but the flag defiantly flies even straighter in greeting the sun. He hocks a glob of spit onto the ground, shifts away from the light, and squints his eyes as he looks up. The material's very new. Not yet stained by rain or dirt. The burlap flaunts its sheen.\nA few days ago, a mechanical arm brushed aside the traps set all around its cabin home, picking flax from the long-forsaken waste, and weaving as its Mom and Dad once taught it. The hand so used to bows was somewhat clumsy, but the metal hand briskly rolled the flax into thread.\nSuppose one said this arm used to be treasured for how it could draw a bow with greater force—now, it had its owner's full interest for how meticulously it could weave. But the mechanical arm understood none of this; it simply followed its master's will, making good on what she saw fit.\nA few years ago, the arm's owner thankfully told the old man that installed it how she would use it to further her revenge. In time, she used the greater force within it to loose arrows into the bodies of mercenaries. She looked at the things they left behind, at the unfamiliar symbol on them—the story of her. Time stopped here, and not a soul remembers all that he was before. She pulled her cloak off, fixing it tight to the wound that almost saw her windpipe slit open. Revenge can easily wipe away a person's past. She didn't want to turn out the same way when her demise came.\nSo she returned to her home, wove this mantle, sought out a firm flagpole, and stuck it rigidly into the soil.\nIt is the final remaining symbol of this settlement in the wilds, and she used her vengeful arm to weave this memento of civilization. The flag rises, the steel arm's owner walks her new path, and those who pass by the banner will recall the pattern she wove.",

The one I'm holding must have had 90{'%'} of its original volume dissolved away before its petrification.\nWhen you think of it this way, it must have been a very big chunk of wood!\nI guess... it was probably as thick as the trunk of that tree the other day?\nIn that case, maybe the whole tree was as big as the Rhine Lab headquarters building!\nWhoa, that's amazing!\nIt doesn't seem very heavy; I'll try to take it back whole. I only hope that the Ursus police at the border aren't too hard on me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 28 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking shelter from the snowstorm outside. It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere today, so I'll stay here and try to rest up.\nI'm all out of drones, too. If I'd kept to the plan, I would've gone back as soon as I lost one of my drones.\nIn normal circumstances, I should have theoretically been able to last a month and a half in the tundra, but the situation here is way too brutal. A month is about as long as I can make it...\nIf I don't find anything once the snowstorm calms down a little, I'll—\nHey, you guys know what I found?!\nA field of flowers right inside the cave!\nThese plants get their water and nutrients from the ice here. They don't grow very tall, but they look like they're doing very well.\nI am taking an entire plant back in a culturing jar. I'll do some preliminary analysis back at the research station, and then bring it back to Rhine Lab.\nI'll try to keep going for two more days once the storm is over, then I'll go back.\nIf I act on impulse again, it might end up killing me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 30 days from the closest research station on foot:\nThere is an entire block of Originium ice crystal standing in front of me. Could be three times as tall as me!\nIt's a whole diamond shaped block, so if it wasn't for the snowstorm here, it'd be reflecting light in all directions. That'd look so cool!\nIt's a shame to just let it sit here among the pile of rocks and snow.\nI've marked down its rough location and taken a picture. I hope I'll be able to find it again next time by following the locator beacon.\nGiven the implications of the crystal being in one intact piece, I couldn't possibly have taken any samples from it. Thankfully, there are more than enough shards lying around that I can bring back to analyze. They'll last me a whole year.\nThat's the expedition's objective accomplished. Now it's time to go home!\nI wonder if I'll come across that police officer I met last time.\n\nThird expedition to the endless tundra, 15 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking a different route this time just like HQ suggested.\n15 days into this route, however, I got stopped!\nIt's an official Messenger from Ursus.\nHe told me there's a restricted military area up ahead and I shouldn't go any further.\nI showed him the expedition permit I got from the Ursus government, their confirmation of my expedition route, as well as the commission letter for me to map this area to show that I have a right to come through here.\nHe wouldn't listen and ordered me to turn back, even claiming he has the authority to cancel these documents on the spot.\nThe words he used had a really strict tone to them, but the way he said it sounded like he was just asking me to leave.\nI have a feeling that whatever lies ahead is definitely worth probing, but I also know it's not a good idea to pick a fight with a foreign official while I'm on an expedition in their territory.\nI told him I understood and gave him a pack of scalecis jerky.\nHe calmed down right away, and said he'd be willing to help me out on my way back.\nAccording to the forecast, there will probably be another huge snowstorm the next two days, so I really welcome his help.\nI may not have been able to complete my survey's objective this time, but the results I have aren't so bad.\nWhat's more, I made myself a new friend.\nThere's some black snow falling from the sky. Is there going to be a Catastrophe soon?\nI picked up a snowflake while he wasn't looking.\nI hope I'll find something interesting out of this.'",

        "description": "I still remember how my first university lecture ended up with us wandering the school building.\nWe were in the classroom at first. Our professor had an amazing reputation, so there we were, waiting for him to enter, introduce himself, and begin teaching—that was a 'class' as we knew it.\nBut once our 'professor' came in, he told us to pack our stuff and follow him. All the students did as they were told, and I was no exception.\nThe whole way, he was telling us about the makeup of Columbia's geology, the manufacturers that made prospecting machines, and various archeological findings, but every time we arrived at a statue or a bust or the like, he'd stop to introduce the next of these historical greats and school alumni that had made outstanding contributions to Columbian expeditionary causes.\nFinally, once he'd made a full circle and brought us back to the classroom, the course's real professor decided to show up. He sent off the old guy, introduced himself to everyone, and then announced that his first class was over.\nYou should've heard my classmates whispering. Was it a prank? Was it some kind of school tradition? Some figured the old schmuck went out of his way to put it on, with all the power he had.\nNot a single person cared about anything he'd just told us.\nNot a one.\n......\nOne day, I was eating lunch by a little brook on campus when I came across the man by accident. Moreover, he seemed to recognize me from back then, and mentioned how I was taking notes so diligently.\nSo I asked him, was he a professor at the school? And his response was no.\n'I just give a little dirty money to the place,' he told me.\nIt was only then that I realized the man in front of me was on the school's Board of Governors.\nHe said he'd retired by now, handed all his property down to his children, and had nothing to do but occasionally come to the school and stroll around.\nHe asked me what I planned to do in future, and I said I was going to be a scientific explorer. 'Nice. You do that for a couple of years, then you retire as a senior consultant for some non-profit environmental org. Good plan, young lady.'\nI said I planned to remain an explorer, until I was physically unable to. It seemed the moment I finished saying that, something in his eyes lit up.\n'Then I wish you luck, explorer. Once you get results... remember to come back, you hear? Tell the next generation the story of their predecessors.'\nThen he left, just like that, and we never crossed paths again.\nBefore I actually took on this career, I thought the whole thing was just a governor giving a student some words of encouragement. However, now I totally understand the hopes, and the expectations, that those words entailed.\nNobody ever made a scientific achievement in one shot. People like to only remember talent, and attribute everything to miracle-workers.\nBut history is very, very long, and filled with all sorts of people giving everything they've got, all so one subject or another isn't forgotten and left behind.\nOur lives are finite, and the new generation's always learning from the ground up. It falls to us to keep accumulating and synthesizing, endlessly, to lay the bricks for those who follow us.\nI don't know if my findings will be enough to change this land.\nI just know that whatever I discover will be passed on to whoever comes next.\nThey won't need to fall where I fell, or bleed where I bled.\nThey can go further than I did, see further ahead.\nEven just the tiniest step can be enough to make new history.\nThat's the day I look forward to.\n—Magallan, foreword to the Instructional Soaring Dragon Drone development files",

Closure ain't gonna be happy.\nSecond, pick your paint. Bright or basic, stinking or scentless, that's just your criteria. More important, coverability and absorption. If your stuff runs the moment it hits the wall, then you're going nowhere no matter how good a paint-bender you are.\nThird, exaggerating your typography...\n......\nFinally, what your graffiti IS. You don't just wanna let off steam. That doesn't DO anything, whether it's paint on a wall or violence on a crowd. It's not art just to soil something. That's not the root of graffiti. You've got to express an attitude, pass on a message... don't get too extreme, but don't ever get wimpy.'\n—Speech by Ethan on a Rhodes Island graffiti art course\n\n'That camouflaging Savra screwed up our original plans.\nYou see graffiti in the slums all too often, it's like ringworms on dermatitis patients, popping up everywhere. A commonplace oddity. So when we planned the riot there, we thought of using graffiti to pass on intel, hiding in plain sight. That Savra did his street art all the time, so we got him in on it with our codes.\nIntel exchange went smoothly. Three different works on the barbershop wall at the crossroads, and we got our time, place and method confirmed—a bombing, to put a little color into this numbed city. Everything was smooth sailing. Final word-out, final graffiti, that Savra decided he'd sneak his own little 'danger, don't hang around here' shit in the corner. Lucky someone else noticed early, covered it in black, got hands on him. Recipient aside, only people who'd even look at that whistleblowing shit on the wall were those drifters on the ground floor. He got a sudden case of conscience, wanted to warn them. Ngong gau!\nYou know how it went after that. He used his color-changing and slipped out while the brothers on guard weren't watching. But you gotta understand, the Savra was usually the biggest wimp you ever saw. Ran away at the slightest trouble. We never thought he'd have the guts to turn himself in to the L.G.D.\n......'\n—Extracts from an L.G.D. transcript of a Reunion member interrogation during a riot incident, later forwarded to Rhodes Island as certain details pertained to Ethan",

But now, we know the address of your workplace. \nHappy birthday, my dear Grace. \nInside this package is my present to you, a toolbag. \nWhen I was young, I always wanted to venture far away, so I asked a famous craftsman in Londinium to make this toolbag. It's very durable, and can hold a lot of things. \nBut after that, I returned to the life that my parents planned out for me, so I never had a chance to use it. \nEven though this world has many ways of stopping a person in her tracks, I believe that you can go further than me. \nYour father is very disappointed in himself. He wants to go to Rhodes Island to look for you, but doesn't know how to face you, nor does he know how to deal with what would come next. If you ever see him, I hope you two can sit down and talk things through. \nMy daughter, no matter what happens, I will always support your decisions and your dreams. \nIf Henry disagrees with you, then I'll talk him into it. \nOne last thing: Your father found someone to make a whole bunch of those sweets you used to love as a kid, even though he was also the one who forbade you from having them... If they show up in the mail, don't eat them all at once! \n \n––Beatrix Arizona \n \n \nGrace, I made a trip to Rhodes Island. Your coworker said you were out in the field, in some dangerous place no less. Something about being a battlefield medic for Rhodes Island. \nThe way I understand things is, Rhodes Island might be one of the best places in this world, but if you stay here, you should behave like a patient rather than running amok like you are now. \nWe can afford the cost of your treatment, but we can't afford to lose you a second time. \nI've brought you some food and supplies. Some of it's perishable, so don't forget to eat it. \nIf you ever need anything, just let me know. \nBeatrix wants me to sit down and have a good talk with you, so I'll come back next month. \nAlso, your mother wants to hear back from you more often. \nThe desk drawer in your dorm was broken, so I repaired it. Try not to stuff too many things in there. \n\n––Henry Arizona",

        "description": "The year she turned five, Waai Fu was taken to a study by her father. A few massive bookshelves filled the room totally full, all sorts of old books all over them, ancient records from all manner, ways and styles of martial arts. \n'Choose one, learn it. In three months, show it to me.' \nWaai Fu—still not able to read too many words—spent a while hesitating, then selected a book from the shelves caked in dust, with 'The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun' written on the cover. Waai Fu had no clue what kind of technique this was, or what characterized it. She simply thought it had a very nice name. \nHer father hadn't given her a single pointer, so Waai Fu had to pore over the books by herself. Yes, she didn't understand the words too well, but the phrases in there—'wicked walks vengeance heady; just employs mind and soul' and the like—flew completely over her head. But she still followed the movements in the pictures, practicing punch after punch, step after step. Assiduous, not allowing an inch of slack. \nThree months later, before her father, Waai Fu finished demonstrating the whole set of techniques, three-hundred-and-twenty-seven moves in all, flowing like nature, not a single one missed. But once her father finished watching, he furrowed his brows and sighed a rough sigh. \n'No. No good. Try again.' \nWaai Fu didn't know why, but had no alternative but to listen. \nOne year later, her father began to take Waai Fu through some simple fighting exercises. He clearly didn't give it much strength, but Waai Fu still found herself caught out again and again, and every time, her father's fists would never pull back as they landed on her. \nWaai Fu didn't understand. Clearly she knew every move by heart, but why couldn't she make fluent use of them? She decided to look within the manual again for answers, and after several times parsing from cover to cover, she finally found, in one unremarkable corner, a phrase. \n'Ways aloft may decree, but man is what makes change.' \nAnd a few more years later, Waai Fu could recite that book in her sleep, the tomes now shelved in a nook of her room, rarely flipped through anymore. In her training, too, her father came to chide her less and less, and she felt he was becoming less strict than he was before. But suddenly, her father left home. He left behind a pair of daggers, and a single phrase. \n'I must go and find something.' \nWaai Fu was unable to comprehend just what could be worth her father abandoning her, abandoning this home, to search for. It was only a few days after that Waai Fu left home too, to live somewhere different. \nWhile tidying her room, she again saw the manual, and offhandedly, flipped through it. From start to end, page by page, it was like her past lay before her. She found, at the very end of the very last tome, clearly written: 'Martiality asks mastery, this only from thorough training. With no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end.' \n'You're right, father. I'll catch up to you, and become stronger than you.'",

During his escape, he tumbled into a hole blown open by an explosion, and found the long dormant Lock and Key by accident.\nWhen he was 20 years old, he became a Caster, and quickly earned the praise and respect of those around him, thanks to the Lock and Key's power.\nWhen he was 30 years old, he had amassed great wealth and a reputation he could have only dreamt of. Yet, he had long since ceased to care about any of that. At some point, he began to talk to his staff day after day. Everyone thought he had gone insane.\nWhen he was 40 years old, he suddenly disappeared from inside the palace one day, and no one knew where he'd gone. Rumors began to spread in certain parts of Kazdel that a madman would tell certain impossible predictions to anyone who passed him by in the barrenlands. For example, that a giant beast would soon lay waste to our nation and that the sky would one day tear in two and reveal its true face. Afterward, he would peddle his watches to whoever stopped to listen, and should they refuse, he would bring their time to a halt.\nBy the time he was 100, he no longer knew where he was, but that no longer held any meaning to him. He believed he was seeking the secrets behind time itself.\nHe had the Key, but where was the Lock?\nHe had the Lock, but where was the Key?\nThe past becomes the future, and the future shall have no secrets. Day after day, he talked to his own shadow, firmly believing that the truth was hidden within.\nUntil one day, footsteps echoed throughout, as three Sankta walked into the underground palace.",

She gave a slight bow with her other hand holding out a magnifying glass before her, and then she took the measure of the villa step by step. All said and done, she lifted her head before the few people now stuck in the place.\nShe seemed somewhat nervous. Everyone could tell as much.\nThe girl took a long, deep breath and straightened her back, attempting to mask her vaguely perceptible timidity and fluster in front of all the suspects. She gripped her pipe tight, and gradually her nerves calmed.\nHer head was quite disheveled, her upwards-springing hair tied into two bunches, with red-rimmed spectacles and shining blue eyes behind them that gave a glimmering and lively gaze at the suspects before her.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen.'\nFrom her breast pocket, the girl produced a pocket watch of fine craftsmanship, clearly exquisitely cared for throughout its years—of which it had plenty—and after checking the current time, she introduced herself thus, in an altogether too spry voice: 'Good morning, everyone. On request, I'll be the detective in charge of solving this case—'\n\nA detective!\nA faint murmur perturbed the crowd. She said she was a detective! Victoria certainly had no shortage of private detectives such as her, who took on all manner of commissions their clients were wary of entrusting to the police. Indeed, it was no unfamiliar profession.\nAnd yet...\nThis self-professed detective girl seemed simply too young!\n\n'Everyone! Hear me out, please!'\nThe tender detective surreptitiously gripped the items in her hands, then raised her voice. 'This may be the first case I've taken on—but—I ask you all to be at ease! I do have the approval of my grandfather and grandmother! I am a qualified detective!'\nShe did seem truly quite proud of the fact that her elders gave her their recognition, as her face which seemed altogether hesitant at first now gleamed bright with confidence.\nIt immediately gave her far more credible airs.\n\n'Thus, I ask you all to cooperate with my work!' said the young detective, puffing her chest out. And then with a bellow, 'I am!—this case's!—detective!'",

The day he succeeded, concluded communications, and walked out that glass door, the eternal lights of the skyscrapers drew his shadow long, and it was only then that Bison realized it was late at night.\nLaterano. At the street corner where the structure above him collapsed with a boom, Bison caught a dessert that almost hit him in the head in his shock. The grand church briefly stole away his senses with its splendor under the sunlight. Soon after, he pushed the door open, where the Legati were sat to capacity inside.\nColumbia. The never-resting pioneer cities gave him a profound respect for humanity's sheer vitality, and the bleeding-edge science made him pore over every clause and turn of phrase in the contracts all the more carefully. Across from him sat several execs, and Bison was alone at the front of the desk.\nSami. He once tested his own disposition and momentarily set foot in the tundra, but unfortunately the youngster's willpower was hard-pressed to bear the might of nature. As Bison huddled in a blanket in the lodge, sipping hot water, a melodious singing voice reached his ears from outside the room. He crawled up to the window, and made a rough note of the lyrics.\nSiracusa. The sandstorm in the barrens tore the map he was holding to shreds, and Bison had to make it to his destination bar going by the lights alone. He pushed the door open, and the three Lupos inside fell silent. He coolly handed over the goods and info, and turned a blind eye to the cold glint of a firearm peeking out from under the blanket.\nYan. He's back somewhere familiar, and familiar too is the party that awaits him again as he enters. Bison recalls his surprise last time candy rained down on him from all over, but now he sees the chaos before him and simply takes the shield his redheaded mentor hands him, now in a very peculiar form indeed, making it hard to tell its original design was of his father's own style.\nHe uses the calm and coolness he's trained on the journey thus far to look as unflustered as possible, but all the charm from across the land flashes across his brain in an instant. Mixed with the music is an explanation to the rough tune of 'We were running a delivery and hit a snag, so we just grabbed it to save our hides. The mods were to make up for that.'\nBison accepts it, this present from his father, and plunging through the tunes and the scent of apple pie, he makes his way to the bar counter and begins to write a reply.\nTitle, greeting, main body. He inquires about his father's health, and writes of how his recent work has gone. He lifts his eyes to see champagne flying at the face of some unknown gang's goon, and Bison swiftly tucks the letter into his pocket and raises his shield.\nIf one day, he could take complete charge... on one hand, Bison is trying to reckon with what all these bells-and-whistles modules are even for, and on the other, his mind is looping the thought that he's going to make this place run like an orderly, regular business for just one month!\n...No, dream bigger!

The gift they'd brought back from Londinium fell at her feet, wrapping stained with blood.\nHer sister dragged her out of the snow, pulling her hand, passing through one alley after another. Candlelight shone on window after window, but nothing lay ahead of them at all.\nWith the footfall behind them drawing closer, her sister told her to hide, finding her the darkest corner to tuck herself in, her chest burning from not even daring to breathe.\n'It's alright now, Loughshinny. Stand up.'\nThe voice of her sister returned to her side. She opened her eyes, saw the firelight creep out from a stranger's window, and it became a strange purple, and malevolent in its very look, scaring even the pitch-black night away.\nHer legs were still too weak to stand. No more did her sister hold out a hand, but went back into the glow of the blaze. She knew that if she couldn't follow, then she would be forever left behind.\nShe grit her teeth and slowly rose up, pushing back the fear and pain, chasing the figure in the firelight. Without knowing it, she ran farther and farther, becoming too but a small shadow.\nEver since, the fire never truly went out. It burned within her eyes, inside her heart, the night of every festivity.\nFive years on, her sister placed a spear in her hands.\nIn her recollections, this was her last time being given a holiday gift. Since then, the flames came to ignite at her spearpoint too.\nSlowly, she became used to the heat, to the scorching that stabbed through her body with each breath. She believed this undying flame would be with her for life, even chasing her in death.\nUntil she received this present.\nShe realizes, and it startles her. So there were people who'd still try to put water to these raging flames.\nIn every test and training thereafter, Reed puts on these gloves, and after the battle, she'll attentively clean her spear's blade according to her manuals.\nShe hasn't told Closure that in actuality, there exists no reagent nor material that can cool a Draco's flames.\nAfter all, when she touched this gift, she truly did feel a long-lost, refreshing chill.",

        "description": "Ambriel received a mission today. \nA mission it might be, but in reality, it's more like a small request. \nOf course, as the request came from Beanstalk, the reward was enough to make anyone's heart waver: an exquisitely-crafted wooden music box bearing a flowering tree. As soon as she saw that music box, Ambriel thought to herself, there's nobody in this world who wouldn't be charmed by it.\n'Please help me! While I was transporting the little metal crabs, two of them got lost! They're very important to me, so please, I'm begging you!' \nWhen Ambriel went to the location indicated by Beanstalk and set up her equipment, she couldn't help but to think to herself, she never imagined she'd be out in the wilderness trying to catch metal crabs. \n'What the heck even is my job...' \n.......\n Well, whatever. Catching crabs might even be fun. All the infected wild metal crabs I've seen in the past were ugly and troublesome, but I've never seen Miss Beanstalk's crabs before. Maybe they're cute. \nInexplicable thoughts ran through Ambriel's head. \nBut the cute little crabs were not today's main agenda. \nAmbriel activated the equipment around her – the sooner she finished the mission, the sooner she'd get her hands on that wonderful music box. \nShe switched on the power, flipped the switch, adjusted the angle, entered the data, and confirmed her target's information... \nBut there was a problem. The radar appeared to be broken. \nBe it the gibberish on the data output display or the smoking battery, everything was telling her the same bad news. \nIf she had to go back to repair the radar, then she definitely would not be able to complete the mission today, and the music box... She definitely didn't want that... \n...... \n'Ohhhh! I have spare parts here!' \nAmbriel's sudden yelp echoed through the wilderness as she excitedly opened a pack of equipment. Her mood was so good she even broke out into a little hum, finishing the repairs in no time at all and returning to her original mental state. \nAfter re-adjusting the equipment, Ambriel would set up the transceiver and begin releasing her Originium Arts–– \nHmm... This reminds me of tracking down those classmates when they were playing hooky. Now, little crabs, where are you......' \n...... \nA few hours later, the pink-haired Sankta returned to Beanstalk with a breeder box, two little metal crabs rolled up into balls inside. \nIn a box behind her were three fowlbeast eggs of different colors. \nBeanstalk got her metal crabs back, and Ambriel received the exquisite music box, so beautiful that one dared not handle it with anything more than the gentlest of touches. \n'I can't believe it.' Ambriel thought to herself while joyfully looking at the music box. 'I can't believe all that equipment ended up being so useful even off the battlefield.~' \n'Um, excuse me, were you planning on hatching those?' Beanstalk pointed to the fowlbeast eggs. 'If you want to hatch fowlbeast eggs, you'll need an incubator, and you'll have to turn them over frequently...' \n'Is it that complicated?!' \n'P-Please don't just throw them out though! You can ask Miss Vanilla... She'll be able to teach you!'",

        "description": "She comes to in the corridor where she played as a child. She remembers; her father's working very late today. She's waiting in the corridor for him. The sunset clouds are chased in by autumn winds, and in this country town where no high-rise nor skyscraper stands, time's gifts are ever there to be seized at the first moments. Quietly, she pushes her father's door open and sees his stern expression—something has happened, her child's instincts say.\nShe comes to in the crook of her mother's arm. She remembers; she is nine now. She should be celebrating her birthday with her friends, sharing the cake. There should be candles aflame, yet the town burns. She sees her mother's face; in the instant she notices her daughter's gaze, the enmity and apprehension is hidden away behind the moon. The night is deep and dark, and her mother tells her it'll all be alright.\nShe comes to in a tent in the barrens. She remembers; this is their third month on the run. The incident in town seemed to serve as an excuse for all the other relatives to shun the mother and daughter. Her faith in and dependence on others left her in the sound of a single crash. She hasn't seen her father for so long now. She dearly wishes to cry and cry, and so she hugs her mother, but droplets hit the floor before she's even begun to weep.\nShe comes to beneath an unfamiliar carport. She remembers; her tenth birthday is very soon. Surrounding her are adults as frigid as ice, one by one forcing out a smile. She is a smart child, and knows these people mean well, but she's only a child all the same. The adults tell her that her mother is entrusting her to Rhodes Island. Her mother has left, like a cloud.\nShe comes to in brand-new bedding. She remembers; her arm is filled with bruising. She used a stolen sheet of sandpaper to rub at her once-smooth skin, hounding the flesh as though it'd atone. It hurts, and she dares not continue, but the moment she thinks of the black crystals, her throat is in the death grip of an all-choking emotion. She wants to vomit. She can't. She hasn't eaten in so very, very long.\nShe comes to the boom of floodwater. She remembers; Amiya and the Infected are still below. Those nameless heroes are resisting a mere Catastrophe. She lifts her head, and as the elements batter all, it suddenly strikes her that suffering is not a matter of great or small, and nor is hope. She throws herself down. Amiya must be alright, at the very least. She hears those behind her howling in fear. She hears them. Infected are drowning here, they say; when the flood recedes, will their water sources be polluted?\nShe comes to beneath a sunset as red as fire. She remembers; she saved a great many at Sugar City, a great many more than she could know. Her mother comes to mind. All at once, she feels sad, yet smiles. She understands her father, but still hasn't been able to find her mother. Can she find her? Will she ever? As the thought strikes her, she has a mild headache, but feels unusually unburdened.\nShe turns her head, and gives the great Feline as badly wounded as her a tremendous chewing-out. 'Blaze! Can't you wake me up any other way?!'",

Kazimierz has long ceased circulation of these old hellers; Blemishine happened to find them sandwiched in her armor while repairing it and gave them to Snowsant as souvenirs. Will they ever be of use? Unsure.\n- One Gaulish copper livre, corroded, from an investigation mission on a formerly-Gaulish site. While Gaul was still around, it was about 10 livres to 1 LMD.

As for nowadays, maybe some collectors would be interested?\n- A few Columbian gold certificates, each with a face value of three dollars. According to Jessica, Columbia never issued money of this value, but that doesn't mean it's fake! Maybe Jessica just didn't know about it.\n- A crude copper coin engraved with Gavial's portrait, handed out by Tomimi. She said it was a precious coin once cast by the 'Gavial's Will' tribe, but Gavial herself refuses to admit this. Tomimi guarantees there are people out there who still acknowledge its worth.\n- An expired Rhodes Island Cafeteria dessert voucher. Snowsant uses it to remind herself—never ever forget to double check when a voucher is valid for!",

        "description": "Every day at half past six, Hung turns on the TV and begins to prep the day's dinner to the tune of a wuxia drama's deathblows and battlecries. There were tremendous lines at the hypermarket today, and it's already past seven by the time he gets back, with the wuxia on TV long since over. But he leaves it on out of habit anyway, and shuffles over to the kitchen to cook.\nThe meat's red and tender; Hung decides he'll mince it and mix in fresh spring onion, planning to fill two tiers of buns. With the meat neatly stacked on the cutting board, Hung picks up a kitchen cleaver in each hand and assumes the Meat-Chopping Stance, when suddenly a mournful wail comes from the living room TV.\n'You've fallen into my hands, Zhong Dafa! You know your blood debt. It's time you finally repaid me!'\nThe cleaver drops with a bang, not into the meat, but straight into the cutting board. Hung shakes his ears—he only hears intermittent gasps and sobs. With no clue about what's going on, he continues the work at hand. A short while later, he tosses the filling into a bowl, and is just about to pour in a few drops of sesame oil when—\n'Stop, Dacai! You can't kill him! The truth is, he's your brother!'\n'Huh?' Hung abruptly lifts his head in disbelief, face blanketed with confusion, beginning to suspect he just heard wrong. More voices immediately follow. \n'Ma, how can that be? I don't believe you!'\n'When I divorced your ba, we each took a child. We never thought it would lead to a mess like this.'\nHung wrinkles his brows, screws the lid of the bottle of sesame oil tight, only to let way too much of the oil out, adding to the bowl of mincemeat the smell of high heaven of sesame. He heaves a sigh and lays the rolled-out pieces of dough in his hand to wrap the buns, all while his ears stand attentively pricked, as if hoping to catch whatever audible clues the television might make next.\n'Hmph. No need to hesitate, Zhou Dacai. Just do it.'\n'Ma, what do I—what do I do...'\nThe buns he is pleating shut are incredibly lopsided, and he finally stops what he's doing and devotes his full attention to the ensuing conversation. Unfortunately, however, someone seems to have changed the channel, and the TV is now playing video game noises, with Waai Fu and Aak's clamorous voices reaching Hung's ears soon after, followed shortly by the sound of Lee coming in. Hung shakes his head and smiles, and places the uniquely shaped buns inside the already-boiling steamers.\nThe clock's hour hand has been on eight for a while now, and Hung gently uncovers the steamers, the clouds of billowing steam revealing the plump white meat buns before him, as the filling's scallion scent slyly wafts from the kitchen and spreads through the living room, subconsciously luring the people towards it and the table.\nThere'll always be people who say eight o'clock in Lungmen is for the eight o'clock sitcoms, but Hung knows what eight o'clock is truly for—the little round dining table, with his folks sat huddled in a circle.",

        "description": "At the border was a fellow of Li, who tilled. He dug up an idol, of more than a chi in length, formed like an armored soldier, vividly lifelike, but its nature was unknown. He gave it to his son, and his son loved it very much.\nThe fellow's son once carried the idol with him to the neighbor's boy to play, imitating an expedition. The idol was light yet sturdy, and all else that touched it fell afoul. The neighbor's boy brought out clay burial figures among others to serve as troops. None could withstand, and he was greatly angered, and abruptly took a hoe to the idol, whereupon the hoe broke and the idol was unharmed. The fellow's son treasured it all the more, always sure to place it by his pillow, thereafter falling asleep.\nThe neighbor's boy told his father of the idol. The father was covetous, and sought to rob it upon hearing of this, believing it to be valuable.\nOne day, upon the city docking in remote regions, the neighbor there entered the house of Li at night, seized the idol and left, to enter the city in his greed to offer it to a noble.\nBefore long, he met a person, who spake: 'To walk at night is very tiring. Rest for a brief while.' He did not answer. Again the person spake: 'The idol in your sack is an infant's toy. I bid you know this; it will not bring you reward, but instead suffer you calamity. You should return swiftly.'\nThe neighbor was greatly startled. He knew he had met an extraordinary one, and could not balk for a moment, only mumbling his assent. The extraordinary one knew his intent, and laughed grandly. The neighbor dared not raise his gaze out of fear. Shortly the laughter fell, but the extraordinary one had thus left.\nThough he feared calamity, he did not return, instead hurrying fast for the city, but the idol in his sack grew all the heavier, and shortly he could not carry it on his back, and dragged it. In an instant his strength was depleted, his mood in great turmoil. Fearful the extraordinary one would take the idol, he thus fell upon the sack, and as he looked all around he wept, and in the end could not abandon it.\nAt daybreak, a merchant passed by, and saw a man lying sound asleep. Before long, he awoke with a start, grasped the sack and spake: 'Do not take my idol!' But the sack was completely empty. The merchant believed him crazed, and left him behind. Thus he was in a daze, returned home, and there fell deathly sick.\nThe son woke, looked all over but could not find the idol, and wept greatly and did not stop. Told by some that the neighbor had thieved it, the fellow of Li sought to question the neighbor, but found him of grave illness, and instead made no question.\nThe townsfolk believed the idol inauspicious, and the son argued with them. And unsuccessful, was angered but spake no further of it. The fellow of Li, fearing his son would walk the neighbor's path in life, sought for it with great care. His son did not become crazed, but began to study forging and casting. Some asked the son of it, and he spake: 'I know the idol is not born of magic, it is the work of real man. I will cast a new idol to prevail over it.'\nThe son grew somewhat older, and forged and cast relentlessly, ingenious of mind and divine of spirit, and word of his reputation reached the capital. A department examined his talent, and weighed him well. He was selected to become a Tianshi.\nFive years later, the son cast an idol, and offered it to all at the Ministry of Works. This idol was fashioned after an armored soldier, clad and equipped full and well, of nature light yet sturdy, and did not rust even when aired to the sun or lashed by the rain. The High Minister was alarmed, and sought to ask of it, and the son told him of what happened in childhood. The High Minister fell silent and did not respond.\nThe son of Li lived to ninety and passed, and his marvelous skills have been passed down to countlessly many, and even now still have their employers.",

It was only a little thing I bought while carrying out a mission in Yan, but the local said it'd been blessed at the temple. Someone tells me I can go and ask Purestream. Purestream... I'm not too familiar with the name. Maybe it's a new operator handling lost and found at Logistics?\nIt's not in my dorm...\nOr the meeting room...\nI find her at the baths. She's just finished repair work, and now she's—well, bathing. I can even hear her singing from outside the door. It's loud, clear and perfect... but don't you feel icky bathing for that long?\n'Sorry, sorry, I know I kept you waiting.'\n'Rhodes Island's sewage work is up to the task, but they've really been overlooking cleaning the filtration system itself. The vast majority of areas have blockages. You need to get into them frequently! All I can do is hang on until the whole cleaning job's done before I... heheh.'\n'Is this your charm? Come and take a look.'\nThe girl absentmindedly talks as she opens a bag. Aside from my talisman, I can see marbles, hair clips, test tubes, and even an ammo magazine...\n'Did you... find all of these in the sewage filtration system?'\n'Yup. It was covered in mud when I found it, absolutely filthy, but I've already thoroughly cleaned it.'\nI'm about to ask 'how could it have gotten there,' but I hold it back. I should be asking myself that...\nLater, I'm chatting with a friend in Engineering about the landship breaking down and getting repaired. Nobody would've called the problem being the sewage systems. Operator Purestream took on the cleanup task all alone after only a day of her job, and she'd spent two whole days inside the filthy inner filtration system... blockages in a few specific areas were the 'main culprits,' all the 'treasures' we'd accidentally lost and couldn't find. I remember Purestream sort of shyly smiled when I told her thanks, and she just urged me to 'take care from now on,' giving me a precautions while she was at it. Water could flush everything away, so we'd gotten used to just twisting taps and pushing on valves, simple as that. It was precisely because water could flush everything that we never knew how dirty it'd gotten, somewhere out of our sights.\nI hear Purestream's in charge of Rhodes Island landship sewage work now. I didn't know what she liked, so all I could figure was to buy some scented soap and send it to her. I only found out later she'd gotten piles of it by that point. I guess I wasn't the only one who wanted to tell her thank you.\n\n—As related by an operator, extracted from a periodic evaluation of Purestream following her onboarding",

You think their families'll want to come looking for them?'\n'Alright, then we're off tonight. Got a dozen labs in Columbia poking us in the arse to get this done.'\nTwo seconds Bagpipe hesitated, then she opened her notebook to look. Three seconds her eyes lingered on the first line, and then she shut it.\nThe sound of a freight lorry's ignition reaching her ears, she glanced left and right, then found the largest parked vehicle around, and with the mission objective on her back, hopped into the driver's cab.\nEngine on, accelerator down, nice and easy.\nThe freight lorry didn't get very far at all, before running straight into a container crane that showed up at the entrance out of nowhere. Driven like it was possessed, it smashed half the warehouse wall while it was at it.\nA few minutes later, the alarmed police scurried over, and led away twelve bandits all seeing stars, as well as Bagpipe, who'd lost a bit of skin off her left index finger.\nOnce back at school, Bagpipe sought out the teacher.\n'I'm sorry about those three requests. I couldn't even manage one of them.'\nFor a long while, the teacher was silent, before picking up a recommendation letter to hand her.\n'Ehhh? Storm Company? Could I really, Mr. Slim?'\n'I had the letter ready long ago.'\n'Oh, thank you, sir!'\n'That said... do you know who the person you got into a car crash was?'\n'The mission target, right? No?'\n'A soldier from the Storm Company acting as an unconscious civilian. She and her squadmates were tasked with taking out those twelve bandits in the first place. By the way, thanks to you, their mission's already done.'\n'So where was my target, then?'\n'In the car accident. Don't worry, none of them came to harm, and they're all home safe and sound now.'\n'Then, umm, then... I completed my mission after all?'\n'You did.' The teacher patted her on the shoulder, let out another sigh, and spoke. 'You pass. After you officially report in for duty, you'll be allowed real Fortcracker shells.'\nBagpipe's eyes went wide. Realizing her teacher meant she could be like all the other students, cheering and celebrating their own happy graduation, she pumped her fists, the excitement growing vast in her face.\n'I was thinkin', odd that 'civilian' was over two meters! And she was just too cool! Can-can-can I really be squadmates with soldiers just like her? I... oh, do I need to think of a codename too? What did you say they all use? Instruments? I... hold on, I don't even need to switch codenames then! Sir, sir, is there anythin' you think I should probably bring when I report in? I dunno, d'you think they might not like mince puddin'? Oh, and, and...'\nDon't fault me for this, Rita, trust me.\nYour teacher can't help knowing she's a true good student, and she'll be... she'll be a fine soldier too, for sure.",

Even though she came on to take treatment and aid, she can still take up the yarn as she likes. She's even started a cozy little class in the sewing room, teaching children who look forward to the future just as she does.\nIt was all curious and new for the first-time visitors. They squeezed about, reaching out to touch all the tools on the tables—a boy amongst them knocked a fabric cutter away by accident, making a slice in the cloth.\nIt panicked the children so suddenly, and without thinking they started to push at the perpetrator, who was even more frightened himself.\n'You messed up Miss Bibeak's clothes!'\n'Miss Bibeak! He did it!'\nBibeak saw the damaged cloth, but didn't even have the chance to speak before the boy, now bright red, fled the room.\nOnce Bibeak assuaged the children, she inquired where he might've gone, and after a knock and an 'Are you there?', the teary-faced boy came out of the door to his room. His head was hung low, and he held out his savings bank.\n'I put all my pocket money in this burdy bank! I'm really, really sorry for ruining your clothes, Miss Bibeak!'\nJust as all teachers should, Bibeak knelt down and softly patted him on the shoulder to console him, and the sobs from the crybaby in her embrace gradually ceased.\n\nThere's always far too much in life that runs contrary to your expectations, just like how Bibeak doesn't know what kind of design her pencil will put to paper in the coming seconds. Will it gild the lily, so to speak? Or will it change everything about what it was?\nShe accepts the savings bank, but does not break it open. She prepares to revise the style of clothing, planning to sew a shirt fit for a grown child to wear.\nOrdinary tailors would amend an unwitting mistake, but a good tailor allows it to transform into a happy accident, one nobody sees coming.\nWhen the children come to the sewing room for classes again, the boy who blundered last time has his head low, standing at the very back.\nWith a smile, Bibeak pulls him up to the table, and takes out the all-new shirt: 'I've accepted your burdy bank. Let everyone take a look, now—these are clothes made for you.'\nThe children erupt in cheers, and they shove on the lucky little boy, clearly even more excited himself.\nHis cheeks are aglow, and Bibeak knows, he'll surely cherish this present, and when he puts it on afterwards, he'll go do the right thing.\nThat's what a tailor dreams of, using needle and thread to sew fine futures and bring them to others.\nPutting wishes and hopes into dress, for every person to wear.",

Where am I gonna get Blacksteel from? We lost a guy just trying to get this stuff.'\n'I need guns I can use! This shit is as good to me as a hammer!' The Vouivre bossman gets angrier, and an assortment of Vouivran musclemen line up behind him.\n'How are you going to use a gun if you can't do Originium Arts? Take it or leave it, I don't refund deposits.' The Sarkaz merchant waves his hand, and one after another, his partners draw their blades behind him.\n'I can fix this.'\nAs the hostility boils over, a young Vouivran man comes out from the corner. His face is stony, his build frail enough to not even seem Vouivre, and his head of red hair majorly garish.\n'I can make those guns usable, and it'd only cost you this much.'\nBoth sides seem convinced by this conservative bid, and make way for him to approach. They watch as the youngster comes up, cracks open the toolkit he keeps on him, and picks up one of the guns. The complete firearm is reduced to parts in his hands, before becoming whole again. His movements aren't fast by any measure, but nobody can tell what happened.\nThe youngster hands the bossman the assembled gun, who doubtfully accepts it. After cautiously fumbling with it, he points the muzzle at the air and pulls the trigger. A clear gunshot resounds through the whole black market.\n'It can only fire one shot. If you want it completely functional, I'll have to take it back to my workshop.'\nEveryone present was ready to slit throats a moment ago, but now all are in unanimous accord. A dozen pairs of eyes focus on the youngster, as if they've found something worth far more than the goods.\n'Boy, what did you do just now?'\n'Don't be twitchy, just hand it over and nothing bad will happen.'\nAs everyone closes in step by step, he suddenly grins and laughs:\n'You foolish philistines! Trying to get a peek of true power with your petite experience? Let me tell you, weapons have souls! Only the truly wise, the truly noble can resonate with them!'\nFor a moment, the chaotic scene once again falls quiet as can be.\n'Lunatic,' the Sarkaz spits.\nThe bossman pulls a whole pile of cash from his briefcase and hands it to the youngster, while the Sarkaz merchant takes the rest and leaves, not bothering with a single glance back.\n'Boy, you can keep your secrets if you want. I'll give you money and a workspace, and you work for me. How does that sound?' He offers an invitation to the bizarre youth.\n'Deal.'\nThe youngster takes up residence in the workroom the bossman gives him. Late at night, he carefully fills a notepad with the quantity and models of the guns from earlier that day, annotated with 'Columbian make, smuggled into Sargon by Sarkaz merchant, circumstances unclear.'\n'Good. We start from here.'",

I've recently discovered that the traditional trolley problem isn't difficult enough to challenge the geeky fellas these days, so I'm working on an upgraded, super-difficult version. I ask of you...' \n'Ahahaha, I suddenly remembered I have something to do. Let's talk more later.' \n'Fortune teller, your divination exists at the intersection of mysticism, logic, and art, just as Conviction's prior trial. I ask of you...' \n'Divination is much more practical than simply confusing people with riddles.' \n'Oh, Singer, I ask of you...' \n'......' \n'An upgraded version of the trolley problem: the surgery problem! Take this doctor next to me as an example. One day, this skilled and compassionate doctor treats six patients. They are dying and each needs different organs to be transplanted soon in order to survive, but the hospital doesn't have any of the organs in stock. While the doctor is performing a routine checkup on another patient, the doctor discovers that the patient's organs would not be rejected by the six dying patients. In fact, they would be a perfect fit. Additionally, this patient is only passing through for a checkup, and even if this patient disappeared, it would not provoke any suspicion. Now then, how should the doctor proceed? \n\nThe trolley problem is not about the answer that the respondent gives in the end, but rather about the conflict between nature and humanity experienced in the formulation of that answer. Whether the respondent hesitates, calculates, finds the situation unbearable, weighs emotions over righteousness or vice versa, all of these struggles are reflected on the outside, through micro-expressions, through one's eyes and very demeanor... \nYou really have no sense of artistry... Conviction, Conviction of course is an art. To stand trial before Conviction is an art. Every aspect of the Conviction Fist is also an art. People who have passed Conviction's test transcend and move to a higher realm. This, too, is art! Ah, whatever, it's impossible to explain these things to you people.'\n'But, you just scared that doctor away!'",

With cup cradled, he stares out at the emptiest street in gold, squints ever so slightly, and under the loop of his collar the crystals at his throat, grown distinct these recent evenings, faintly stings. \nHe remembers the ringleader, who rarely shows in person beyond giving him instruction, raising the matter with him not long ago. \nComing with praise, eager to see the day he truly joins. \nSaying, I hope you reserve nothing for this play. \n—It will be his stage alone. \nAt times, the performer feels a whisper of anxiety, source unknown. But beneath that unease pallid as the Victorian mist, it is clear to realize for him that he cannot hold back the feeling of joy. \nThis will be no ordinary play, a play like no other the traveling troupe has hitherto performed, unlike any stage he has trodden before. \nThis will be his play, and his entire life, his kismet... \n\n'Mew.' \nA black kitten appears on the street corner. Few have seen a being beautiful as it, as if a certain legend where at times they show before others as they please, a legend as if the black cat here now. \nThe performer's train of thought is broken. The uncanny fervor in his eyes dissipates, and his look relaxes, watching the cat delicately pace towards him, and he lets out a smile unawares. \nHe is in love with coming to this little town's street corner these days. On it there are few, and it is calm, and the tea is not exceptional, but a black cat does always patron it, placing golden sunsets underfoot with its perfect composure, on its leisurely stroll. \n'Meow.' \nIts tail elegantly sways, approaches his side. \nThe performer tries to reach a hand out to the black cat, and it gives an askance look, its ears shake a shiver, but it does not show immediate refusal. Thus he carefully strokes its finely sheened fur, the sunset that lingers on this kitten soaking into his fingertips. \nHis smile supplants all other mood in his vision; the performer has long since had a fine name in mind for his unusual new friend, and merely has not given it yet. \nHe has decided, if this black cat keep coming forevermore, he will ask her: would you like to walk with me?",

For people like them who deal in blood, letting the goods escape doesn't just affect their reputation, it impacts their business, so they'll kill their friends, and it won't weigh on them one bit. But for the sake of this innocent girl, nothing will stop her.\nCutter conceals herself in the pitch-black night. A dull, bad sweetness emerges in her throat, reminding her of the blood that coated her under the blazing sun in times past. But the girl on her back grips Cutter's arms tight, reminiscent of that day years ago, when she herself gripped tight onto those machetes with no owner.\nShe pushes the girl up on her back, adjusting positions, freeing herself up.\nIn the interval where her taut nerves relax, the aches on her body come with—Cutter uses the moonlight to inspect their wounds on her. A bolt shot at them hours earlier cut her shoulder and the girl's arm, the blood of the two congealed together. In this moment, thanks to the movement, fresh blood finds a way to well from her shoulder again.\nCutter tilts her head to look, her mind beginning to ring thanks to this trouble from nowhere.\nThe rope that fate bound around her neck suddenly tightens, and Cutter begins to feel this instant that her very breathing is beginning to freeze. Her hands turn cold in an instant, her heart pounding in her ears with every pulse, and she feels this darkness will drown her.\nCutter stares in shock, rooted to the ground, the cut on her shoulder smoldering red.",

        "description": "The mercenary's bag has an interlayer, and within it go things she doesn't normally bring out.\nYoung, wandering children are all too common a sight across these lands, most clinging onto their bitter lives. A little girl pleads with a group of monsters, hoping to be spared some food.\n'Please, please, help me!' says the little girl, 'I can do a lot of things, I can help you too.'\nThe monsters take pity on this wasteland vagabond, and they accept her, allowing her into a small den she can call home.\n'You're so nice!' she says, with her tiny cloth bundle. 'I can hunt—I'll bring back even more food for you.'\nThe skies grow dark, and dark means unsafe. She shrinks into her hiding spot, looking out at the dim sky.\n'We don't have enough food. You said you would hunt. Now's the time.' The leader of the squad of monsters brushes its hair out of its eyes, and says to the girl, 'Bring back more food.'\nThe girl journeys out alone into the dark, and all the creatures under the night sky tuck themselves away, leaving her with nothing. But, far in the distance, she catches sight of a small campfire, a bag of food full enough for several days, and a seemingly very listless mercenary.\n'Take it.' The thought pops into her head. Finally, she reaches out and manages to grasp the bag. Inside is something she hasn't eaten in a long time—real food.\nSnatch it, steal it, whatever it takes. Getting it is the only way the monsters will recognize her; taking it is the only way they will let her stay. She clutches it tight and starts to run.\nWith the mercenary giving chase, the girl runs all the way back to the squad of monsters, and they rush at the mercenary, claws out.\nBut the wails she imagines never come. The mercenary seems to be saying something in a loud voice. The girl peeks out from behind the bonfire. The mercenary takes the monsters once more into the black night, and after a brief departure, they come back.\nThe monsters are delighted, crying out in celebration, as they haul a modest convoy of supplies out from the night. Time passes, growing darker still, and it comes time to rest.\nThe girl lies down in relief, the mercenary takes watch duty, and after they are done celebrating, the monsters too sleep beside the bonfire.\nShe takes stock of this newcomer, and the newcomer returns her gaze. After a brief moment of eye contact, she turns away and shuts her eyes.\nThe monsters murmur as they dream, and the mercenary adds some wood to the fire. Only one pair of eyes is open, glinting in the flames, and they size up the camp.\nWhen the only sound to be heard by the bonfire is steady breathing, the girl opens her eyes.\nOnce all the other sounds completely disappear, she emerges from her hiding spot.\n'We make a good team.' In the mercenary's hand is a blade, slicked with a liquid, thick and red. The girl looks around, taking in the state of the camp.\nShe finds a patch of ground to sit down on, still more or less clean. The mercenary starts moving the things back to their camp, and, left alone, she looks up at the moons.\n'...Traitor!' The sole remaining monster charges out from some corner, breath ragged and letting out an incomprehensible voice. It grapples the girl.\n'I'm going to die like this,' thinks the girl as she struggles desperately. 'I can't die.'\nA hole is made in her little bundle; a shard of a blade cuts through the cloth in her grip and slices her hand. She grips this shard tight, and thrusts it into the night over and over, until the monster can no longer hold of its weapon. Thick, sticky, red liquid trickles to the floor.\nSurvive.\nInside the interlayer of the mercenary's bag is the shard of a blade, something she placed in there even before she was a mercenary.",

The doctors say it's because of overwork and so on, so I have to recuperate, and I'm not allowed to go and look after the plants. That's why I need you to take over some of the Convalescent Garden's work. I'll write what you need to do underneath, and if you're not sure about anything, you can ask Miss Lena to teach you. I'll recover as soon as I can, so I won't keep you for too long.\nBefore I introduce the work to you, please take a look to the right of this letter. There's a pouch with floral teabags, and some tasty little snacks. They're all for you, to say thank you. Go on and have them while you read below.\n\nYour daily work will involve the following:\n1. Temperature logging and warning. Each greenhouse entrance has a terminal to control the thermoregulatory equipment. You just need to check each day if the figures are normal or not, that's all. If the equipment's giving a warning, then report it to Miss Lena as soon as possible, and she'll help you solve the problem.\n2. Operating the lighting. The Garden's lighting systems are all unified under PRTS control, so you don't actually need to worry too much, but just in case it's not working properly, you'll need to operate them manually, and adjust them into the correct positions. I've drawn detailed directions on another sheet, so make sure you look over that carefully.\n3. Plant irrigation. You can leave most of the plants alone, and the greenhouse will sprinkle them at the same times each day. The schedule should be stuck to the door, so don't go inside when that's happening. There's some other flowers too, the ones in my studio, and I'm really sorry, but all I can do is ask you to take care of them for the time being. I've labelled how much water and nutritional fluid every plant needs on their pots, so keep a close eye on the markings on the spray bottle, and don't give them too much.\n......\nThat's all I wanted to tell you. Once again, thank you for finding the time in your busy schedule to help me. If you like the presents I left you, then I promise I'll make more for you once I'm back in shape.\n\n\n—Podenco",

He has only ever seen their faces on a couple of group photos.\nWhile apparently this is not at all uncommon for children born on board Rim Billiton's mining ships, it isn't something one would consider normal, either.\n\nLike many other Cautus children, the boy is very active and tends to get into trouble every now and then.\nIt might therefore be hard for those who rarely visit the library to imagine him pouring through the books on technology his father left behind.\nThe most likely source of this habit is an erudite old man with whom he is not related, who has always kept him company and reprimanded him since he was a child.\n\nWith such an unusual guardian, the boy had some perfectly natural questions for someone in his position.\nWho were his parents? How did they die?\nThe boy does actually have a vague idea. He long ago learned from the books what the equipment and instruments his father was standing next to in the photo meant.\nThe boy is much more delicate than he appears. He is worried that perhaps the reason that no one ever mentioned his father until he broached the subject is because his father had put everyone in danger with a work accident. That they avoided the subject so he wouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe erudite old man can see that the boy has his misgivings. However, he had promised Alisha that he'd take care of her child, that he'd never let him choose the arduous path that his father once walked. That he'd never tell her child that his father spent his last moments selflessly entering collapsed caves to rescue strangers that didn't believe him, under the guise of conducting a post-Catastrophe inspection, and that he'd keep him from thinking that his father was to blame for his mother's final days in depression.\nHowever, there was one lie that the old man cannot bring himself to tell the child. He doesn't have what it takes to tell the child that his father wasn't a hero. As the ship's former Catastrophe Messenger, the old man cannot help but take pride in the young man who found himself here after being framed in Victoria, but nevertheless dedicated himself to fighting Catastrophes.\n\n'But, Alisha... Didn't you name your child Leonhardt because you were hoping he could be like his father...?'\n\nPerhaps it is the fate of his bloodline at work, but the boy could not be dissuaded from studying to become a Catastrophe Messenger. He met friends with whom he could trust his life, and he quickly earned the recognition of many of those around him.\nThat came much later, though.",

        "description": "Chernobog.\nNatalya curled up her legs to cover them with the plastic sheet. She already knew how to get a little warmth while sleeping alone, and how to avoid being discovered by other refugees or the Reunion Movement. It wasn't actually time to sleep, but she was too tired. In hopes of getting Lada a little soup with flavor for her fever, Sonya grabbed half a leather belt off another group of refugees. And, of course, they didn't let her go easy. They chased Sonya all the way back to their hiding place. The commotion woke the already weak and drowsy Natalya. She used the huge weapon she had been carrying on her back for the first time.\nA few days ago, they dragged it out of a burnt-out ruin, and after inspecting the remaining parts, despair yet again cast its shadow on their hearts—it was practically unusable. Natalya describes it as a former siege weapon, now abandoned. Several eyes looked it over only to fall into silence.\nBut Natalya still found a few almost-usable cloth straps and fixed the huge device to her shoulder. Anna and Sonya said nothing, they just clutched their own handy weapons tightly and walked on in silence. Natalya followed.\nThe massive weapon now rested across the bottom of Lada's neck, covered with a layer of found fabric, making it just a little bit softer. It didn't actually fire anything that could cause any real damage in the recent scuffle, but Natalya stood in front of a few already-broken refugees, and snapped off a component of unknown function—the weapon worked strangely, a mixture of thick black smoke and flames gushed out, igniting the debris next to it. The fire drove off the refugees who were pursuing Sonya, meaning they lost their own hiding place.\nSeveral hands tugged at the plastic sheet in the corner. Anna coughed weakly, trying to muffle the sound in her throat. Sonya stared into space with her eyes wide open, not allowing herself to sleep. The flickering flames in the distance reflected on their faces. The feverish Lada suddenly clenched her fists and woke up from her sleep, muttering and grabbing the small pot next to her, preparing to rush out.\nAnna skillfully placed her hand over Lada's forehead, and Sonya pressed down the corner of the plastic sheet to prevent the wind from coming in. Through the gap in the sheet, they saw the dark night sky, glittering stars, and Natalya, still cowering alone nearby. Lada murmured and reached out to her, and after grabbing her equally pale hand, she quieted down and slowly fell back asleep.\nThe next day, Natalya felt an unfamiliar warmth beside her. When she woke up, she saw a small, yellow, dirty star-shaped plush toy hanging off her weapon, swaying back and forth. Lada wrinkled her nose and laughed.\n\nRhodes Island.\n'Please wait a moment, Sonya. I'm not ready yet.'\n'Ugh, you suck, Natalya.'\n'Listen, you're a logistics operator, and you're the one who applied for a replacement weapon. How did I end up being the one pushing <<i>>you</i> through the process?'\n'Because I suddenly realized that I've gotten used to it.'\n'You've never even fired the thing. The last time you tried, the pile of scrap almost exploded on you.'\n'I know how maximally utilize its functions.'\n'You told us it was a military siege weapon.'\n'Well, I like its color.'\n'Ugh, are you screwing with me? Do you wanna use it or not?'\nThe white-haired girl laughed. She fiddled with a dirty, tattered, star-shaped plush toy behind her back and remembered the night when she huddled with her companions for warmth.\n'I've changed my mind. I don't want to replace it. To me, Sonya, it's more than just a weapon.'",

With her outfit all together and a thrice-over in the mirror, she took her papers and tools with her, off to what was now her position in the Rhodes Island Medical Department.\nIt was an uneventful day. She got seated at her workplace, met Atro and the rest of her colleagues, set up her itinerary, went to a meeting, ate lunch, wrangled all manner of IDs, confirmed the laboratory she'd be using, ate dinner, chatted with Professor Kal'tsit, and went to read in the library. That was it, sunup to sundown.\nHowever, a subtlety to Kal'tsit's actions weighed on her mind. When she looked at Folinic, her eyes seemed inadvertently drawn to her cravat. Folinic had met with Kal'tsit several times throughout the day, and almost every time she did that, as small as it was, to the point she'd thought she was wearing it wrong, and that was how Kal'tsit was opting to notify her. Yet when she got back to her dorm and stood in front of her mirror, she found the cravat still tied neat and tidily upon her chest.\nIf something was wrong, Professor Kal'tsit would've mentioned it on the spot, Folinic thought. She untied her cravat, then tied it once again.\nSo, what exactly was the issue?\nFolinic puzzled over it, and in short order took it off, only to put it back on slowly this time, once again remembering how her mother taught her to tie it—\nA choked gasp escaped her throat before she covered her mouth. Folinic was a very disciplined person, but at this very moment, she was losing control over herself.\nShe tried to hold back her voice, but managed only to sob in heavier, more broken fits, almost suffocating.\nEven standing up straight felt beyond her, and her hands could barely brace against the table before she fell to the ground, where she curled into a ball.\nRationale? Wisdom? What use were they?\nAching—weeping—these were all she had left.\nA pain that a single night could hardly quell.\nHow long must it take, until you finally move past losing family so close to you, and all the inexhaustible grief—how long until you finally forget?\n......\nAt dawn the next day, Folinic came to on the ice-cold floor. She wiped her tears dry, went to the bathroom, and ran a cold shower. As the bracing water struck her back, she planned in her head to open up more possibilities in her own work.\nJust before she left, she picked out a jet-black cravat for herself.",

It won't work anymore if you do.'\nShe knew what its internals were, really. It was a simple thing. Figured out with just a touch and some general knowledge.\nBut she chose to believe, and wait.\nDay, after day.\nFinally, one noon, the tremoring inside her personal pouch stopped.\nHer mom suddenly showed up behind her, and her dad was carrying a massive bag, his face filled with the gentle smile she so missed.\nPromises are something this couple never neglects.\nThe family briefly reunited on Rhodes Island, and spent several days and nights worth remembering.\nBut very quickly, they once again bid farewell.\nThis time, her father solemnly read out a prayer and opened the sealed omamori, while her mother carefully examined the watch face, and wound the pocket watch's spring.\nThey finished their parts, and soon asked Suzuran to tie the omamori's rope tight.\nThis simple, unadorned ceremony did not go on for long, but it was a concentrative, serious matter for all.\nA kannushi, an assassin, an operator.\nA father, a mother, a daughter.\nThrough this tiny omamori, the three's souls were bound together tight as could be.\nIt is respect, through which promises are kept.\nIt is trust, through which endurance is willing.\nThe land throws them far apart.\nBut love transcends space and time, granting them the power to meet again.\n'Once this omamori no longer tick-tocks, we'll be back with you.'\n'Until then, remember to go to bed on time~'\n'Mm-hm!'\n'Have a safe journey, mom, dad!'",

She's withdrawn but decently polite, seems to be a well-raised young lady, but none of that's what he's really focused on.\nNo, Chiave's started noticing her because she keeps coming to the garage, but she's got nothing to fix. Not just that, but she keeps walking over to him, asking him questions about work. She struck him as the annoying sort of amateur, the kind he'd just say a few words to get off his back. Later, though, something made him change his mind about her: a customer came complaining to his boss about how Chiave installed vertical jets and sprayed graffiti on his car without permission while fixing it up, and filed it all under repair costs. The girl made herself known at that point, said she thought Chiave's mods were super sick, and even footed the compensation for him.\n'Huh, this chick's got some taste,' was Chiave's mental comment.\nOne day, she shows up in front of Chiave again, this time with a fancy cake for him. He wants to refuse her, but she says, 'I'll get fat if I eat too much cake, so I may as well give the rest to you,' pushing him to begrudgingly accept it. He's surprised to find, though, that he's had this kind of cake before, and it's his favorite. He's got a million thanks for the girl, so he decides to get her a precious gift in return, the likes of which have never been seen before. He explains his idea his buds—Broca and Aosta—and asks them to help out. Broca's naturally on planning and prototyping duty, and Aosta's not so convinced by Chiave's proposition, but reluctantly designs the exterior and gives input on some of the finer details, while Chiave himself handles the imagination bomb he's throwing down in the making of it all. Finally, after working several nights straight, the three's masterpiece of blood and sweat is ready to see the light of day.\nThe next time the girl visits the garage, everything plays out as they envisioned. With music playing that Broca put on in advance, Chiave (with some effort) presents her with the gift, and recites his speech: 'You like it? It's a jack I made especially for you! Even if you get fatter now, you can hoist yourself up into your car with this. You'll never need to worry about packing on weight again.'\nAnd since then, not once has the girl been seen at the garage again. But in the Chiave Gang's collection, there is now an unusually shaped, repainted jack, serving as an heirloom of the Chiave Gang to be forever stowed away.",

According to the data stored in its program, you would at least need a cushion and an ergonomic backrest for something to qualify as a chair.\nHowever, if Scene has no qualms with this being a chair, then Lens is certainly in no position to complain.\n'How much longer?'\nScene asks in her usual, sluggish tone.\n'Only 200 meters more! We'll be there soon!'\nAlthough it had figured out what its owner was going to say long ago, out of courtesy and respect, Lens waited until Scene actually asked the question to reply.\n'Oh.'\nScene returns to her silence.\nThis morning, Scene noticed a small hill as she relaxed on Rhodes Island's top deck. Although it does not compare to Sargon's tall mountains, the path they are on has nothing but flat plains, making the unexpected mountain a sight for sore eyes for Scene.\nShe firmly believed she would be able to take photos of the most breathtaking sceneries on that hill.\nSo, driven by her impulse, she immediately had Lens take care of the paperwork and borrowed a car and a few helping hands to race to the hill. This is quite the urgent issue to her, it seems.\nAlthough there is still a ways to go before she reaches her destination, Scene has already started to think about everything:\nThe angle, the lighting, the colors, and the ratio.\nThese are questions that Scene is almost always thinking about as she goes about her everyday life.\nThis is her profession as well as her hobby.\n'We are almost there, Miss Scene. The destination is right ahead, past those rocks! But neither the cameras nor I can climb any further. I am afraid you may have to walk the rest of the way.'\n'Okay.'\nScene slowly slides down from her 'chair.'\nShe readies her camera and slowly makes her way up. \nStep by step. \nBit by bit. \nThe sunlight at last reaches her eyes, revealing the world before her—\nShe still remembers how warm the sunshine was as it lands on her cheeks and how cool the breeze was as it brushed her arms.\nShe remembers the fowlbeasts' melodies, the fragrance of the flowers, the crudeness of the rocks.\nThe greenery extends endlessly until it reaches the blue sky. \nRays of lights pierce through the clouds up above.\nScene is always working on the composition of her photos in her head. \nYet when the scenery actually opens up before her eyes, thinking only serves to distract her from the task at hand. All she has to do is chronicle the view before her faithfully.\nRaise the camera and press the shutter button.\nThat's all photography involves—\nAnd what an enjoyable experience it is.\n*Ka-chick*.'",

Starting today, I will teach you how to make finballs.' \n'One makes a finball the same way one makes a man, and do you know what the most important thing is?' \n'It's––' \n'Slow and steady, one step at a time!' \n'But you said the most important thing was to never lie, cheat, or steal...' \n'There are many principles required to make a man, and you would do well to remember them all!' \n'When I make finballs, I have to do every single step starting from the slaughter. So, in order to learn how to make finballs, you must also learn how to use a knife.' Uncle Tung pauses for a moment, as if sensing that the words he wanted to impart are too difficult to articulate. He squeezes out the sentence, 'I'll demonstrate one more time, watch carefully.' \nUncle Tung takes out a rolled leather bag and spreads it across the table. A row of dazzling knives reflect a blinding light. He retrieves a lively finfish from the water tank and slaps it a few times against the chopping board, its movements soon ceasing. He then takes out knives of different shapes and sizes and in turn, removes the scales with a small knife and slices open the belly with a large knife, each step orderly and neat. He shakes the complete finfish around in his hand a few times, and it turns into several different parts, neatly placed upon the table. \n'It seems complicated, and that's because it is. I'll tell you the principle behind using a knife - practice makes perfect.' \nI follow Uncle Tung's example and learn from him. I learn to slaughter the finfish, then how to make filling, then finally how to make soup. Uncle Tung calls me a fast learner, and it doesn't take me very long to join him at the stand. \nOne day, a few people come to eat finballs and order a whole lot of them. They get up and turn to leave without paying. \nUncle Tung has always allowed credit, but I know these guys and I know they aren't going to pay. Angered, I decide to teach them a lesson, but Uncle Tung rushes over and steps between me and them. \n'It's just a few finballs, just a few coins. All you have to do is remember to make up for it next time. There's always next time.' \nI had no choice but to give up, but that makes the punks even bolder. One of them shouts: \n'You filthy hawkers, clutching books all day. Think you're all high-and-mighty or something?' \nUncle Tung turns around to face them. I can't see the expression on his face, but the punks look like they’re staring straight into hell itself. They half-run, half-crawl over each other as they scramble away. \nThat night, Uncle Tung gives me that set of knives. \n'Make sure you take care of these. They might look old, but they're not cheap.' \n'Let me tell you another principle for how you use knives. The most important thing is to hide how sharp they are.'",

I just don't like things that are a pain in the ass. \nIt's noisy as hell, there's alcohol, wrist wrestling, and inevitably, a little girl named Tomimi always shows up... Any single one of these things in isolation, I can probably deal with. Some, I might even call cute, but when you smash everything together, that's what you call a pain in the ass. I much prefer enjoying a glass of juice alone on the deck to spending a night at the bar. \n\nI'm almost out of juice. \nOne nice thing about being alone is that it's comfy. One not-so-nice thing is the fact that you get bored easily. \nI open up my toolbox with the mod kit and start to do maintenance on my 'gun.' Guess it's one form of entertainment. \nTwenty seconds, it's completely disassembled. \nEighty-one seconds, every part's squeaky clean. \nThirty-five seconds, the lubricant on all the metal parts has been replaced. \nFifteen seconds, the reassembly is complete. \nIf the thing in my hand was the real deal, I'd be able to do a whole lot more with the mod kit. Unfortunately, it's just a weirdly-shaped crossbow that fires a special ink bullet. Doesn't actually use Originium or anything sensational like that. \nSome things only work in the right hands. Trying to force them onto others won't end well. \n\nJust as I was deciding if I wanted to get a second glass of juice, I hear a few other people step onto the deck. Other than the sound of their footsteps, they aren't making any other noises. The people wisely keep their distance from me and stop on the side of the deck. \nBefore long, I hear a soft singing voice from them. I look back, and as expected, it's a group of Abyssal Hunters. \nAs soon as I see the three of them, my heart starts to beat faster. I once told to the Doctor it was love at first sight, though of course that was a joke. In reality, my best guess was that this unusual physiological reaction was probably related to that incident when I was a child. But I've never asked about it, nor do I think about it much. Wouldn't be able to get any answers anyway, and all the thinking in the world wouldn't solve the problem. In the end, I'd just be causing extra issues for myself. \nAnd I have a hunch – it'd be a hundred times more of a pain in the ass than Gavial dragging me to a hundred bars for a hundred nights. \nSo, as long as that thing stays far, far away from my daily life, I'm good. I have no desire to throw myself headlong into something that's gonna be a pain in the ass. \nBut occasionally, every so often... \nWhen I close my eyes, I'll see that person. I have no idea who that person is, but I can tell, they're at the center of this whole mess. \nSomeone wrapped in the smell of the sea, a robed Iberian... \nI stand up and sling the gun over my shoulder, pick up the only toolbox messy enough to be my own, and go to grab my second cup of juice.",

Could be doing WORK here... If someone's my disciple, they're worth educating. She learned how to test microcapacitor unit performance and then straight away, she managed to fumble a whole breadboard together! She's gifted! Really resembles me there! And she's hardworking. Read through every single engineering book the landship has over the past half year, and she finds people to discuss with everywhere. They don't put half of the true might of technology to print, though. She's got a lot more to learn. As for why she's so eager, well, don't ask me. Probably hasn't scooped her jaw up from the floor since she landed on Rhodes Island... She's had two sorta major awakenings in her life, right? First was seeing a nomadic city pass by with her own eyes when she was a kid, second was seeing a talking Lancet-2 in Acahualla. I can see the hopes in her, for machines, for herself. There's a possibility in there... in the not-distant future, I bet she'll be able to build machines with her own two hands that surprise even herself. Maybe her creations will lead Terra in technological innovation. I might just hand my Chief Engineer position to her when the time comes, it's not out of the question...

Zumama couldn't figure it out, try as she might over three straight sleepless nights.\nGavial saw the heavy bags under Zumama's eyes, and on one hand showed the appropriate concern, while the other hand was clenched in a fist as unreserved as ever. Zumama crashed to the floor, but showed no hurry to get back up.\n'Old Man Zuluzhak said those things were nomadic cities. What's a nomadic city?' Zumama asked as she stared up at the blue sky, giving her friend the same question that had been bothering her for three whole days. She'd never been this hung up before. Even the mushrooms she'd never seen before growing on trees only lingered on her mind for a day and a half.\nGavial gave an answer she considered incredibly wise, a saying she'd heard from Old Man Zuluzhak. 'It is why it is, and that's why it is.' Then she started pumping her arms. 'You rested enough, Zumama? Let's keep going!'\nZumama suddenly felt a little listless. She got up, and walked off to where the nomadic city had sailed past. Its outline was still faintly visible, but her eyes could see far further than her feet could take her. How could a child's gait ever catch up to a sailing machine? Sunset came, and she felt the distance between her and the nomadic city hadn't narrowed one bit.\nShe felt somewhat dejected, and gloomily sat on the ground, but bumped against something as she did. From underneath her, she pulled out a strange metallic ring. Zumama had once witnessed the most experienced boy of the tribe show off roughly the same thing. What was it called, again? A short name... a 'nud'? Maybe a 'nup'?\nZumama put it in her pocket. It was likely the thing hadn't even come off the nomadic city—it was just some careless traveler's dropped belonging—but all the same, Zumama loved it, very much.\nShe began to collect these abandoned and scrapped metal parts, putting them together with no principle whatsoever. At first, she bound them with thread, then stuck them together with glue, until she eventually learned from a passing caravan what welding was.\nFinally, one day, this strange little contraption was born from Zumama's hands. Gavial and Tomimi's verdict was 'ugly', but still, she loved it, very much.\nShe clasped it in her hands, and came to where she once saw that nomadic city. It had long since vanished, but Zumama always had a feeling she could sense the tremors from it as it sailed.\nSuddenly, a strange Liberi showed up beside her, and asked, 'What's on your mind there, young lady?'\nShe tightly gripped the tiny, ugly little thing in her hands, so hard her fingers hurt.\n'I want to make it move.'",

Should've known Columbia was like this. Always has been.\nNo one who could've helped that kid. Went by the nickname 'Aciddrop.' Got into competitions. Glowed like the sun on the outer dunes back then. Now she caught Oripathy. Whereabouts... unknown. I wind this tape up, that marks one month she's been missing.\nStill remember how I taught her to use a crossbow. Spark in her eyes, same as my wife and kids. Touched your heart some more than a breeze in the woods, and my girl—girls—[CHUCKLE]—I thought to myself back then how I pretty much had two goddamn daughters. 'Aciddrop.' She was like part of our family. Like candy. Sometimes her father came, checked in on her. Gaulish man, built strong. Nothing but guilt and love in his eyes whenever he looked at his daughter. He and I drank. He said he didn't know how to be a good father. Could've said the same myself.\nUsed to figure with how our families knew each other, be one of the few fancy things in my old age, but that all changed. Overnight. Kid, uh... left two skateboards here with me. The ones I 'confiscated.' Dumped them in the junk room too. Rolled right under that army sword from Bolívar.\nI'm just an old guy. Saw these things happen before—never concerned me then. Wanted to do something... only today decided what. I know, look at me, death of a salesman. Best decision maker zero years running. Heh.\n[SILENCE]\nTaping two copies of this. Remember to send one to the kid if anyone finds her. I'll teach you how to fry onion rings for it. Secret's in the cheese.\n[SILENCE]\nThey've got the smarts to stick with their own. Not much chance I come out on top. Feel sorry for my girl. Her dad shouldn't be taking a risk like this. Makes me glad, though... I fessed up about all this and she was in tears. Gave me the go-ahead.\n[SILENCE]\nHey, kid. My daughter's all grown up now. How about you? Where you at?\nNo matter where you are, I bet you'll get along just fine.\nGangs. Hah. They gonna be scarier than the Steam Knights? Fire raining from the Witch King's spire?\n[SILENCE, POURING LIQUOR]\nRemember this, kid.\n'Cheers to freedom, cheers to onion rings, and cheers to me.'\n—Video cassette, previously held under strict safekeeping at a police station, sent to Rhodes Island after a case of station theft.

The vast streets can be seen from the roof of this building, as well as the spotlights shone skyward from the gym several blocks out. Unlike Rim Billiton, there's no stench of slag on the evening breeze, nor the dust Rhodes Island so often faces in storms while sailing the wilds. It's clean, and strange for it.\nHer field mission concluded two hours ago. She made sure to put on her favorite band's bracelet as she set out from the Rhodes office. Had a whole disguise on and everything. Still got stopped outside the venue. 'Our tickets aren't for sale to the Infected. We need to ensure the safety of our other concertgoers,' the worker said, while taking a cautious step back. 'Sorry.'\n<<i>>Yeah, figures I'd get caught,</i> she ruefully thinks, stood below the looming white gymnasium walls. Infected have their own neighborhoods, their own perimeter walls, and their own checkpoints. Rhodes Island spent a week of classes teaching her that Oripathy wasn't something you could transmit just by brushing past someone else, but it's not like she can teach the whole city that.\nOh well. She's on the roof, right here, right now. She takes off her headphones.\nRhythmic cheers and shrieks pour out of the circular venue, indistinct by the time they reach her ears. They're a lot like the calls she used to hear from the mines. In this moment, they echo the beat of her heart. She reaches a hand out towards the spotlights in the sky, almost able to feel the air shaking. Even though that concert venue all bedazzled with lights feels as far away as the moon.\nIn that sea of noise, an extremely familiar intro faintly reaches her, every note mixed in with the city's clamor.\nShe needs to be careful. She can't get spotted. But she still waves her braceleted hand in time with the music, lightly singing as she does.\n<<i>>So lucky I got to apply for this field mission, seriously,</i> she thinks.",

        "description": "Truth be told, Kowal has a dream. He'd already made the kid's come true.\nOnce, Maria was viewing her ancestor's portraits by Margaret and Auntie Zofia's sides, listening to them tell legends of Kazimierzian knights of old. She lifted her head and asked her sister: 'Is the armor they wear the same as yours?'\nMargaret smiled and shook her head.\nThen Maria asked: 'What about the sword?'\nUnable to hold back a laugh, Zofia decided they'd pay a visit to Kowal's knight workshop while the weather was still good.\nThat afternoon, Maria saw Master Kowal hard at work in his shop. He was always a friend to his friends, and on occasion boisterous too.\n'If a knight's honor really be measured in a crown, then that crown's going to be made by the Craftsman's Guild,' Kowal laughed, as he picked Maria up.\nMaria didn't mind the smell of iron at all. She watched the delighted expressions flit across her sister and aunt's faces as they looked over the weapon, and her eyes shone brilliantly.\nLuckier still, she just so happened to be deft at the very thing she was interested in, which raised her spirits.\n'She's a jack-of-all-trades, I tell you,' Kowal said, wiping the foam from his mouth. 'Say, remember when we were holding that lone city out on the plains? Remember all that work the old one-eyed boy from the blacksmith's got up to, and we thought he was just some nobody? If it weren't for him, we'd have caved before reinforcements arrived!'\n'Of course I remember! How could I forget!' The old knight's face was aglow at the mention of tales of the past, and even his own drunkenness slipped his mind. 'But what're you saying? Maria could match that, no contest!'\nKowal would normally have fired a retort at his old friend out of habit, but as that stretch of the past washed over him, and he remembered the brothers-in-arms they'd lost, he fell quiet. His silence said enough though, and V took a swig of his drink before lowering his voice. 'What d'you think of her, that Maria girl?'\n'Me?' Kowal came back to his senses, went briefly blank, then let out a huge grin. 'If Maria'd been around back then, holding the city would've been nothing. Could've even counterattacked! And done it damn well.'\nV said nothing. He simply returned his own grin.\nFor the banished Margaret had come to mind.\nMaria had cried for days and nights, even wailing about how she'd go find her sister herself. It was Zofia who soothed her to sleep, and kept her company at home.\nKowal loathed himself for doing an awful job of protecting the Nearl family, and was ashamed of what old man Kirill might've thought. All these years, he'd hardly done any work himself.\nRust. Creeping across the surface of this radiant, beautiful city. Yet the old boys could hardly do a thing anymore.\n'I'd give anything to hear those lively sounds a-banging away again. We need that girl's hands...' Kowal mumbles to himself.\n'...Too much to drink, methinks?'\n'No, like this, you see.'\nKowal sidesteps the question and gesticulates with his hands, as if he's holding a hammer, and the scene outside the tent's a thousand miles of grassland lapping at the white clouds, and the lumber and the stones pile up high amidst the sounds of knocking, forming a grand castle.\nClank—\nRinging through the air.",

In effect, her opponent already knows her like the back of his own hand.\nShe had also heard that the Fissure's armor was forged specifically to take on her weapon of choice in battle.

Alas, it all turned out to be true.\nZofia is starting to get discouraged. After all, her last few matches have all resulted in her defeat.\nHow many companies are there sponsoring Fissure? Are there really tens of thousands of people racking their brains together just to figure out how to take on the Whislash Knight?\nShe needs to find a way to get herself out of this, lest she gets defeated yet again.\nDid Nearl use to fight all by herself as she is doing now?\nDid she waver and hesitate when she found herself at a disadvantage?\nShe knows the answer, and she also knows very well that she is not Nearl.\nWhen her techniques, weapons, and armor are unable to give her any advantages, the only things she has to rely on are the same things that led Nearl to victory.\nConviction and determination.\nShe starts switching up her attack patterns, even using techniques that she has not yet completely mastered.\nShe's relying more on her blade than her whislash to attack.\nNow, Zofia the Whislash has a clear objective:\nShe must confuse her opponent.\nShe must wait for her opponent to become distracted for even a second. \nShe must snatch his weapon away with her whislash. \nAnd before its threads snap, she must strike her opponent down!'",

Each of the heroes, seemingly just as young as them, had a shiny and glowy Originium blade and could use super-awesome techniques that made the whole screen flicker and shine like crazy, and it got everyone watching all pumped up. But then Shamare, who's always so cold, was there all alone like 'that sword's obviously just a toy' like she didn't get the mood at all.\nBubble wasn't one to say much about weapons, really. Swords were all light and fragile, and they'd never beat the cool stuff like giant axes and hammers.\nBut when she saw the friends she'd watched the film with get together one day and bring swords out, that really drove her nuts.\nThey were just like the ones in the movie! The shininess, the little button, and the dashing-ness that exuded from her friends when they lifted their swords to the air and yelled out the super-awesome move name.\nAnd like that, a need to HAVE overtook Bubble's heart.\nShe couldn't steal anyone's—she'd been scolded enough times already for that—but she had no idea how she'd get one like that for herself.\nBy buying it? How? From who? With what? She didn't even know how many rooms were inside this metal plate box, not to mention her friends were telling her they got shipped in from Kazimierz and she can't buy one now.\nWhy can't Bubble get the thing she wants?! It was all her mind could dwell on, but here she is now, and she doesn't know anything, except that aside from stealing someone else's she's got no way of getting the toy. But the lessons she's been having lately, and the sense of morals educated into her, stifle her urge to snatch one.\nSo now Bubble can only storm around in a huff, carelessly knocking into things and yelling loudly to vent her discontent. On occasion, when she tuckers herself out, she hides away in her dorm, crying as she hugs her tribe's totem.\nThis helplessness weighs down on Bubble very, very hard.\nMorte tastes this morsel and shares it with Shamare. After getting the rough gist of things, Shamare seeks out a psychological consultant operator at Medical, and very soon thereafter, a message is sent from HR out to Sargon...\nToday is Bubble's annual 'See Papa Day,' in which her father has agreed to come visit her once a year. It's the most important day of the year to her (aside from her birthday), and Bubble forces herself to shape up and look strong, to meet Papa with a smile. Even still, once she sees him, the gloom in her heart all spills out as tears, and she can't even put her words together properly, only lie in her Papa's arms and cry away.\nAfter the tears are done, she jumps out of her Papa's embrace, and sits silently on the couch again. And surprise! From his rucksack, her father pulls out a toy sword.\nIt's in this instant that Bubble's eyes shine like stars.",

We all muttered how it was some devil's witchcraft silently spreading about, and so we all kept our houses tightly shut. But we didn't have the heart to throw a single frail woman back into the wild in the rainstorm, so we agreed to let her in.\nShe first moment she laid eyes on Veitch, she sensed something was wrong. She was prudent as we worked through his symptoms with her, and she asked how the village at large was doing, before revealing herself to be a roving doctor.\n'This is no Originium Arts; it's an illness. The soil and wellwater is contaminated, and the children are the first to be sick; as the poisoning builds up over time, the adults will come to show symptoms too.'\nShe opened her suitcase, and mixed a medicine with practiced hands. As she did, she spoke. 'I'm sorry. All I can give myself is a temporary first aid, but the only way to cure an illness such as this is to be away from the contamination's source, and convalesce through medication in the long-term. If possible, I'd ask you to tell all the village that they should move away from here.'\n'But this is our home,' my husband said with worry. 'Even if this soil will harm us, where are we going to shelter if we leave here?'\nThe doctor said nothing more. She worked in simple silence.\n\nThe weather had cleared up the next day, and I found the doctor just as she was about to leave. On the door was stuck a wild flower, a kind that grew anywhere. In that instant, a faint memory of someone seemed to match with her in my head.\n'I remember you, doctor. I've met you before.'\n'I was still in a small town on the outer edge of a nomadic city. You'd make home visits to everyone, and you always secretly handed out fresh flowers to us children... I was behind the curtains watching, I remember seeing from there.'\n'That was decades ago by now. My mother caught Oripathy, see and we were driven out... and I've gone from a child to a married woman now, I know you wouldn't recognize me. But, well, you look about the same now, compared to all the way back then.'\nI told her how grateful I was for her, from the bottom of my heart, for she cured me of my fever when I was young, and now she'd saved my own child too. Yet the look on her face was at first blank, then became so sorrowful, as if she was close to weeping.\n'No, please... don't go on any further. Just treat me as though I'd never visited before.'",

Here I am, in the end, only now realizing I can't form a clear picture of what it is I even want to do. \nI'm certainly not qualified to be lecturing you on this occasion. \nOn another note. You have a certain fondness for elaborate toys, so I've made you a Rubik's cube. It's open to being dismantled, and there are some tricks to it. I trust you'll like it. \nMay your future be bright. \nSilence",

        "description": "When Hildegard left Laterano to set foot on this trying journey, she received a little pouch. Inside was a small handful of the season's grains.\nIt was a tiny tradition of Landen Monastery's. Hildegard had seen her seniors off to far away lands with much the same thing. The clerics would pick out the best of the monastery's wheat, thresh it with great prudence, then dry the grains and place them into a hand-sewn pouch. They held within them Landen Monastery's fine character and glorious mission. It was said they blessed the Landen Guard in times of tribulation.\nHildegard and her senior clerics had discussed this legend's origins more than a few times. Some held that the grains could serve as emergency rations when in desperate straits, but others held their own views. Legend also told of a great Landen soldier who used the wheat he carried on his journey to brew a batch of beer, and brought a safe source of hydration and protracted merriment to villagers whose water had been polluted.\nAll told, wheat was a wonderful thing. Bread and drink, more often than not, came from it. It symbolized an enduring hope. Whether the people longed for luscious joy or a peaceful life, they would find it in these grains.\nHildegard had always held the same, too, until she passed through an ancient battlefield on her journey. The Landen Guard had faced the enemy on it some centuries ago, and she'd once read how bitter, how fierce the campaign was. She'd thought it'd be a wasteland covered by the stench of grief.\nBut no, it was now a field of wheat.\nThough a field of wheat, it seemed altogether inappropriate. The wheat growing here had no farmer to tend it. It sprang high over the plains, filling her view. It was the harvest season, and the golden ears glittered brightly in the downing sun.\nHildegard gripped the pouch in her hands. She understood. This field was born from the blessing she held in the heart of her hand. It had been nourished by blood.\nShe suddenly recalled the pet name the clerics of Landen Monastery gave these pouches. 'Seeds of Tomorrow.'\nHow would tomorrow turn out? Nobody knew. Maybe the same as ever, or maybe stained in tears of blood. But with these seeds in hand, there would be beauty in the end, sprouting from whatever became of them, even if it was watered by hardship.\nHildegard carefully stowed away the pouch of tomorrow's seeds, to grow again one day.",

        "description": "During her years of wandering, Hildegard had visited many cities across Terra and witnessed all manner of wonders. One day, she happened across a small village near Ursus, which was almost completely isolated from the outside world. The residents here had never cared about things like faith or future, working tirelessly only to fill their stomachs. But in this village, there was a young girl who knew the history of the Landen Guard and remembered the teachings of the Lateran Pope, as her grandfather had fought alongside the Landen Guard in his younger days. Although these experiences had long since turned to old memories, and the old memories simplified into bedtime stories for a little girl, their power to promote belief in salvation had not waned. In the eyes of the little girl, Hildegard's arrival fulfilled the promise of salvation in the teachings and prophecies. So, during that harsh winter, as the little girl lay dying, she implored Hildegard to give her a Lateran funeral, using her one and only precious glass bead as payment.\n\nHildegard prayed quietly for the girl, according to the teachings of the Lateran:\n'When this land disappears, so too desire disappears. But those who serve the will and purpose shall have eternal life.'\n\nSince embarking on her journey, Hildegard has been collecting stories, artifacts, and legends left by the Landen Monastery and Guard, organizing them into a notebook. It contains an old medal purchased from a destitute wanderer, a strange Sarkaz bedtime story about the Landen Guard, and even a review of cystymilk bread by a famous food critic from the Yan.\n\n'Like in a certain story my father told me when I was little, no matter how far you wander in the forest, even if you lose your way, as long as you follow the breadcrumb trail you left behind, you can always find your way home.'\n\n'But in the story, aren't the breadcrumbs eaten by a fowlbeast, leaving the boy lost in the forest forever?'\n\n'Uh... Anyway, what I mean is that as long as those who need it hold on to faith, the story will survive alongside drinking and merriment. No matter how far you've wandered, Landen Monastery will always be there if you are willing to look back. It's all worth commemorating.'\n\nThis is where Hildegard's optimism comes from. Although she has imagined several possibilities for the future of Landen Monastery, whether it is forced to close due to poor management or destroyed in the chaos of Terra, the greatest challenge is that the ideals and functions the monastery represents are no longer needed by the people, or even the Lateran. But despite such worries, and despite disappointment and setbacks time and time again, she has never stopped.\n\nThe teachings of the Lateran tell us what we see is not that which we see, it is what we do not see. It is the unseen that is eternal.\n\n'Of course, I think if we compiled the collected stories and legends about Landen Monastery into a book, we just might be able to... raise some more money!'",

The instant he says it, he regrets it. But Iris isn't upset in the slightest, but instead conscientiously asks: 'Why is that?'\n'I heard a fairytale, growing up in Victoria. About a witch wandering the land, filching children's most precious things, locking them away in a castle in the woods... Of course, never to return. The collection fills the witch's empty heart, but the children carry their regret and resentment into adulthood.\nIt scared me like you wouldn't believe. All night I clutched the necklace my mother made for me for my birthday, a beautiful little pentagram. The witch never took that though. Instead, she took my mum, my dad, my entire village... Catastrophes from nowhere, flames of war that never went out... Miss Iris, there's no castle like you say, not in Victoria, not even in fairytales.'\nFinally, Joaquin asks: 'Miss Iris, did you leave anything of yours to the castle, when you were young?'\nIt's a difficult question to answer, and Joaquin knows it. It's like asking a magician if their head really does come off from their body. If little creatures really do come out of their hat. Those who create Dreamland exist detached outside of it, they don't believe in it. She could easily lie, of course, and tell you she believes.\n'It was the castle itself,' Iris says with almost no hesitation. 'I dreamt of it when I was quite young. It was grand, full of different rooms, each one filled with towering cupboards, all specially made. They could lock away time itself, and nothing would ever rot or fall apart inside... And because of that, I'd never lose anything beloved to me ever again. After I awoke, Grandmother made that castle I dreamt of into a pop-up book, and I kept it safe. Later on, she took me to the castle, and shockingly, it was exactly as both my dream and the book. And that book went into the very first shelf of the very first room. It was then that she asked me, you know, if I'd be willing to serve as the castle's master, and bring help to all the children.'\nJoaquin is sure Iris isn't lying; he's confident in his observations after being with Rhodes Island for so long. Even if what she says is so... unimaginable. She doesn't think herself a cheap conjurer—she *is* the creature in the magic trick, dwelling in the realm of fairytales. Joaquin supposes that's why the children aboard all trust her. As he speaks, his hands are still busy helping her stow away the sweetie boxes and toy models by size.\n'Sorry for bringing up something so pointless, Miss Iris.'\n'Your necklace there...'\nJoaquin looks down at the silver star nestled in his chest, now tarnished into an entirely different color over the years.\n'Mr. Joaquin, you are your own Castle.'",

She tugs on her collar, and continues to observe as sand blankets the land and sky outside, wondering what's going to happen once class is out.\nBrutal winds assail unabated, the sand within rattling and pattering against the glass with a great clamor. The long-bearded professor is forced to stop teaching, and wait for the noise to subside.\nAmidst the dense sandstorm, Tuye notices a buckthorn plant shuddering about beneath a dilapidated wall, a flower bud somehow still surviving on its sparse branches. Tender, frail, liable to fall away in the wind at any time.\n'Tch...' Tuye shuts her book and stuffs it in her bag, stooping low in preparation to slip out the back door.\n'It appears you think you've already grasped this. Am I wrong, Miss Tuye?'\n'Huh?!'\nTuye looks up, and sees the professor standing at his lectern, arms folded, giving her a look of annoyance.\n'What was I saying just now? Answer correctly and I won't deduct credits.' The old professor strokes his beard.\n'It's caused by the steam trap having an insufficient pressure differential, leading to steam leaking from the condenser.'\n'I hadn't gotten that far yet, Miss Tuye.'\n'You were about to, weren't you?' Tuye wiggles her eyebrows and lets out a smile.\nFaced with such an irrepressible student, the professor can only heave a sigh and give his begrudging reply.\n'Fine, get out of here. You're not helping me.'\n'What about my course credit?'\n'*sigh* Just this once, I'll let you off the hook.'\nClearing his throat, the professor is about to continue where he left off, when Tuye's next remark suddenly angers him to the point his beard stands on end.\n'You know, you can dock some if you really wanna—I'm way above a pass, anyhow.'\nTuye hoists her bag and is sprinting out of the door by the time she finishes, leaving only the hinges slowly shutting, and an ear-piercing grumble.\n'Get back here, you little goddamn lout!'\nThe professor's bellowing is loud enough to be heard outside the lecture hall, and fades away in the hallway along with Tuye's cackles.\nMany years later, Tuye still regularly thinks back to her student days and cracks a smile—to this day, she and the professor have unfailingly kept in touch by letter. And every time she finishes writing one, she takes the condenser still off her backpack and pours the water into the planter on the windowsill, where a lush and beautiful buckthorn grows.",

As bubbles and white smoke erupt uncontrollably out of the water, in unison with an intense searing sound, she finds herself unable to take her eyes away.\nThe cooled dagger sits atop a smithing table, and Lava herself personally etched a crude depiction of her own horns on it.\n\n'That's so sick! Miss, I want one too!'\nThe children of the slums rarely get to eat anything tasty, and they have certainly never seen the sweet treats that Lava is so fond of.\nEver since Lava removed the small, sweet-smelling pouch dangling from her waist and carefully divvied the snow-white, delicious treats evenly among all the timidly outstretched hands, the children here forgot all about the stories their parents had told them about 'Devils'. They even began looking forward to this super cool lady coming to play with them.\nWhen she sees that the animosity in the children's black eyes has faded bit by bit, from both time and her displays of goodwill, Lava finally asks a question that she's wanted to ask for a very long while.\n'Do you guys know what Arts are?'\nLava starts to manifest red, burning flowers one after another, their branches glowing beautifully under the night sky.\nThe children want to approach, but are too scared to. Lava then takes their hands and crouches down to teach them the basics of Arts.\nLava has never seen them imitate her so excitedly, and, surprisingly, she finds a few of them managing to eke out a few sparks. Their Arts may be crude and imperfect, but they certainly lit up their elated faces.\nLava decides to do something that she's always wanted to do.\nEven just for material reasons, it's a good idea to learn Arts. It helps you find a stable job and fills your stomach. You won't have to starve in the cold slums anymore. It's how you escape the fate that's haunted you your whole life.\n\nAs time goes by, one day after another, the world hasn't gotten any better. Nor has it gotten any worse. It yet fosters both misfortune and joy, as well as life and death.\nThe children here have learned the Sarkaz's Arts. They haven't become any better or worse, and they continue to live here, peacefully as ever. But their future has already started to change.\nBy passing this newly forged dagger around from one tiny, curious hand to the next, Lava is slowly changing things her own way.",

        "description": "At Hui-ch'i's peak, in a humble abode 'twixt bamboo thicket, a red edge is dyed in ink, blade pointed at a scroll.\nThe hills range lofty, river water ceaseless, nature in all its colors, vegetation in all its fragrance.\nShe gazes afar to the ends of the vista; she brandishes blade and splashes ink.\nClear black washes ranges, pine soot works jade branches, dry brush masses steep heights, pallid shadow forms hazed clouds.\nA painting complete, the blade stowed away.\nIn careful scrutiny years later, Dusk gives a light sigh.\nThe mist-drizzled scenery has lost all shade; only white left on this scroll laid bare.\nHui-ch'i's vistas, painted through a million's times.\nWinter cedes and spring comes in with blooms and trees profuse; down from Heaven sable stone descends in alien clumps; opened mounts and given roads do Heaven's work in whole; now visits another year of celebration's hour.\nShe sees then sees again; paints then paints again.\nIs tired; is loath.\nLet this brush travel its own way, then.\n......\nWhen Dusk snaps out of it, she finds a small being on her parchment.\nThough wreathed in soot and ink, held prideful as prominence, it is at a proper look still but a youngling.\nAnd this youngling looks at Dusk in turn.\nThe brush is no brush, the ink no ink, the scroll no scroll. All formed things, false.\nBut that animacy, that spiritful will, gives some ever-so-slight joy to Dusk.\nShe suddenly feels a little of her mood return.\nHalf a day later, the small being is lively across the wealth of her canvas.\n'That old idiot would have even more pointless words for me if he saw me brushing life out of nothing.'\n'But still...'\n'The way this realm has no bearing on how you are, I suppose that's a little interesting.'\n'No place of place amidst high mounts or waters far; no matter to me free amidst the human realm.'\n'That's it.'\n'I think I'll call you 'Free.''",

The lyrics were vague and resisted understanding, and its repeated retelling seemed to have corrupted it several times. However, the events directly referenced by the warped lyrics led the Candleholder to be uneasy. When he inquired with the children whether they knew the meaning of the lyrics, and where they heard it from, they unanimously shook their heads. Left with no alternative, the Candleholder transcribed the lyrics and let the children return home.\nAfterwards, the Candleholder got in direct contact with local authorities, requesting they bolster security administration and enlist more emergency workers to respond in the event of sudden disaster. At the end of that autumn, a flood broke out in the area. With grain harvests under thirty percent of previous years, it was fortunate that local authorities had long since prepared, and were ready to send in grains from nearby cities, leading to no further unrest. Post-disaster reconstruction work was likewise completed smoothly.\nAll aforementioned events have been recorded in Sui Regulator files.",

If you drink that whole ladle, all my effort today is gone to waste.'\n'Hm? Mayst thou explain?'\n'On this mountain's shone side are three thousand mu of fertile fields, and in its shade, thirty thousand qing of lakewater, but Mt. Mang stands straight in-between rising to the clouds, cragged and long, troubling even fowl to cross. The seedlings need water, so I have no choice but to draw water from the north side to irrigate the fields on the south, and I have only this single ladle to use.'\n'Hence why thou makest such arduous journeys in such unending succession? But until when wilst thou bear this ladle?'\n'Well-asked. Until when, hm...' So replied the old man as he sat down on a mountain boulder, letting out a sigh.\n\n'Ah! Then allowest me to help thee, good sir!'\n'You would?'\n'I have given it some thought, and believe what thou hast said to be wholly reasonable. Were it a spade at hand, thou wouldst find a canal to dig through Mt. Mang from north to south. Wert thou of Arts that could shift towering earth, thou wouldst employ such powers to move the mountain, and let lake and field border one another. Yet at hand thou hast but a ladle, so scooping water turn by turn beest thine only option. A task faces thee, and a tool is at thy hand—as it must be done, so one is bade to do all they can. 'Tis as such.'\n'But the fields that way are so wide one cannot gaze to their end, and the trail over Mt. Mang is so perilous and winding, one loses their way in the fog. You may be decades younger than my decrepit self, but what could you accomplish even giving the rest of your life?'\n'I seek not to be able to irrigate the fertile fields. Should I walk the mountain path once, that is one refinement of my spirit. To pour a ladleful of water is but the fortune to do so.'\n'And more, the ladle thou gavest me in kindness was destiny in turn. I am young and hale, and my pace quick. 'Tis only natural that I help here!'\nSo spoken, with more than half the ladle still filled, Saga took it into her steady hands, and turned and went for the mountain's shade.\n\n'Truly, what a fool.'\nA gust of wind blew by, cloud and ink scattering, the mountain path long and unending, and all trace of the old man had vanished.\n'Foolish and naive, but devout and sincere. She can go as she wishes.'",

        "description": "When he left Lien’s, it had been raining for several days and nights in Kou-wu City. The fallen sycamore leaves densely covered the ground, burying the smell of fish beneath the soil. He bolted the gate of the kung fu hall from the inside, and in the dead of night, took a copper rod from the weapon rack used for emergencies, climbed the wall, and left the courtyard. \nNot long afterwards, a town near Kou-wu City found itself one sunglass-sporting fortune-teller extra. On sunny days, he would set up his stall at intersections, and on rainy days with few pedestrians, he would take his umbrella and go fishing by the river outside town. The umbrella perfectly covered him, its ribs heavy so it would not blow away. Some envied him for living such a flamboyant lifestyle - was he so attuned to Heaven's will that he could keep his head up above the ocean of mundane affairs? Others accused him of being a cheat and a fraud, questioning if he really knew his own destiny. \n'Of course. How could I not know?' He would reply with a smile. \nAn umbrella only protects one from the rain, but not against concealed weapons like arrows or darts. His umbrella torn, he has no choice but to pack his bags and find another town where he could mend his umbrella. Numerous are the days of dark wind and rain, and he gradually feels that he had nowhere to go. All he knows is that the endpoint of his life will still be at that martial arts hall. He needs not walk the path that follows afterwards, but he knows not how to traverse the path leading there. The inch of ground beneath his umbrella is hardly enough for him to settle down, for it is no solid roof. \nBut it is then that he meets a strange group of people. Later, he learns another saying from those people. If translated into mandarin Yanese, it would be 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.' \n––The above is what Operator Mr. Nothing told you personally. Rhodes Island is currently running from a small-scale Catastrophe in the making at full speed, but Mr. Nothing is lying on a chair without a worry in the world, his umbrella tied and tucked away at his side. Through the porthole, you can see the sun behind the Originium rain. \n'The sky clears after the rain passes. The Heavens have eyes, and gaze down upon us. Say, Doctor, would you care for a pair of sunglasses?'",

The toughest battle he ever endured... was just a match in a Kazimierz arena.\nIs he really qualified for this job?\nWhy would a Columbian recruit a group of warriors from all across the world?\nJust as these thoughts run through his mind, someone pushes open the door.\nA tall, red-haired lady wearing sunglasses walks in.\nShe has a small gun hanging from her waist, but she is not a Sankta.\nShe walks up to the podium, clearly in no hurry.\n\n'Welcome to my squad.'\n'You can call me Ash.'",

Three hours? Five? The golden sands rush through my clothes, tempest throwing the dust against my face, without reprieve, so rough against my eyes I have to keep them shut. But we can't stop yet—the Sarkaz mercenaries behind us are still fast on our tail—they're trained and tireless—even a sandstorm couldn't hold their march back. \nAnd the water... might have been drunk dry long ago. \nI've heard traditions that in the desert, filling empty canteens with sand can give people hope, but right now, I've drunk enough sand. Water—I just want one gulp of water. Even if it costs every coin of mine in exchange, I would do it. \nBut in these wilds, the shine of metal has no meaning at all. \nClutching this silver case tight, I grit my teeth and keep striding. \nMy ears are battered with mournful screams. Like the deceased are howling, and ghosts are calling. Maybe Professor Thorne is among them, calling my name? \nBut I can't quite make it out. \nHow long has my brain spent filled with these noises now? Three minutes? Three hours? Or three years? \nThe dust has blocked the sky out, day and night all the same now, time practically stood still, and only the people seeking to survive through all this still endure through this welter of punishment. \nI just wanted to research, I just wanted to offer my strength to the furtherment of science. I didn't want this—desiccating away in this sea of sands—not like this. \nMy head aches and swells and stings, my body seemingly gone long without any sense. Am I walking, or am I watching this body named Elliot squirm? \nNo... thinking too has become too much to ask. Only one thing wanders in my head, a single order: move. \nMove... move... move... \n...but the desert is limitless. \n'Elliot, open your mouth.' \nOpen my mouth? \nI subconsciously slacken my muscles, let my lips and teeth reveal the channel to my oral cavity. \nA fruit coated in sand and soil lands in my mouth. \nAcrid? And sweet? Oh, it's water. It's water. \nIt's water. \n...... \nSince when, I don't know, but there's no more wind at my ears, the land has returned to peace, and there's only sun, sand, and two earthly humans walking through the dunes. \n...... \nI gaze off far. Beyond the yellow dust, is still more yellow dust. \nNo end is in sight, just like technical documentation scattered all across the ground to be trodden by wet leather shoes, no longer able to be reassembled, nor made sense of. \nIn anger, I kick at the sand, and watch it tumble and slide down the dune, then blend again into the desert, as if nothing ever happened. \nSand, sand. \nI begin to hate sand for the first time in my entire life. \n'Let's go. We'll be able to replenish supplies very soon.' \nKal'tsit interrupts my train of thought. \nUm, very soon? How soon can it be? \nAnd resupply? How much could that be? \nBut—Kal'tsit never promises hope to anyone. \nBut at least... \nI think I can see a cactus.",

        "description": "The Reefsteep Black Market, where I was born anew.\nAt the end of the western passage, one can see the land and the sky. Once, it was an arms dealer's territory. I worked under him in my first few years in this place. He was a born despot. He left several welts on my back, but I've no hate for him. It was only natural, just as it was only natural that his irate underlings slit his throat in drunkenness, before throwing him from a cliff. I placed my first gold coin in those turncoats' hands, and it was warm to the touch.\nThe northern oasis, Reefsteep's border. For a time and an age, the favored turf of the mercenaries. Soldiers were replaced batch by batch, but there was only ever one leader. My biggest customer, and the one who taught me how to taste wine. But that winter, he died. He died in front of my storehouse, his body bruised and battered. He coveted my creations, and died to my precautions. Mercenaries keep no loyalty, and thus I rewarded his subordinates at his funeral. Unfortunately, his life couldn't even buy a decent bottle of wine.\nThe southern side, where the towns sit. Messengers and merchants come and go in spades, the value they trade in circulating through the villages. The lords recognize as much, hence why Ibut's lord ameer had such a special fondness for the place. Sargon's unbearably chaotic, barbaric politics never interested me, but I needed the lord's support. The division of powers within the Reefsteep Black Market bored me so much I'm loathe to mention it, but we all had something to say when it came to the lord. I'm surprised that I held such frail relations for so long; a lord that doesn't judge by the cover, perhaps? Out of respect, I didn't personally attend the revolt. But once his family were puppets, I did show up to pay respects to that poor boy—he was akin to Elliot. Akin to me.\nThe Reefsteep Black Market's center. An old tomb lies there, an ancient pasha's grave. Every night, Isin carefully wipes his memory under the light of the stars. A long time ago, I exhausted his wealth. And by now, I've repaid him several times over, but he doesn't pay any mind. His age looms by the day, and aside from a few errant, insignificant questions, we never even speak.\nThat day, Old Isin asked me why others call me 'Sand Soldier.'\n'Sand Soldier.'\nThe meaninglessness of a grain of sand. The pathetic fate of a pawn. The term is filled with significance I abhor.\nHence why I gladly accepted it. As a price paid in advance, for the impossible trial to follow. The Reefsteep Black Market had its towns, and they were fuel ready for the fire.\nI waited for the lord ameer of Ibut to come. If I could, I would have burned even the golden sands to nothing.\nAnd in the final moment before I set the flame alight—\n—what came to mind was the afternoon a young Elliot Glover was taken to tour an institute of science, where he sees a new model of Originium engine ignite and combust, upon which a tremendous machine stirs to life. He's always remembered how much that moved him.\nI've always remembered.",

        "description": "She squeezed the trigger, the bowstring rebounded, and the bolt flew out with a whistling sound, hitting the bullseye dead on. Toddifons walked forward and looked at the bolthead buried in the bullseye, but failed to find any joy in her heart...\nThe entire testing field was a mess. Standard crossbow bolts were stuck in targets, two or three armor-piercing bolts were stuck in the wall, and several shattered targets bore the signs of explosives. The operator in charge of the field had never seen anything like this before and ran off to report up the chain, leaving Toddifons to tinker with the bolts out of spite. Before long, another bolt was firmly stuck in a target.\nWhen the testing field supervisor was dragged in by an operator, Toddifons was installing more lethal heads on the bolt, before turning to shoot her target full of holes.\nThe supervisor remained silent for a while, then, without looking back, pulled the operator along towards the workshop. Nobody knew what madness had gotten into Toddifons, but one thing was certain: if anyone dared to go in there, this crazy Vouivre would probably use them for target practice.\n...\nWhen Toddifons's supervising craftsman arrived at the testing field, the entire area looked like it had been carpet bombed, every target in sight has been thoroughly struck by Toddifons's siege crossbow. She was now sitting quietly next to the weapon, motionless as a volcano about to erupt.\nNobody had ever seen Toddifons like this before. No matter how the craftsman spoke to her, she remained unresponsive. So, after confirming that there were no bolts loaded into her crossbow, the craftsman asked the operator to come in and clean up, while continuing to try to communicate with Toddifons.\nIt's unclear how much time passed before she suddenly snapped out of it and asked her supervising craftsman about parts parameters and mechanical adjustments. The craftsman answered the questions one by one, and relieved a lot.\nIt seemed like the volcano wouldn't erupt today, he thought to himself. So he sat next to Toddifons, watching her adjust the siege crossbow and fire a new bolt that lodged itself dead center in the freshly-replaced bullseye. Just like before, Toddifons pulled out the bolt, looked at the target with disappointment on her face, and walked back to her weapon.\nThen, before the craftsman's eyes, she threw the bolt like a spear. It shattered the target and embedded itself in the wall of the testing field.\nAfter throwing it, Toddifons stared at her supervisor with her hands outstretched and an unusual look of helplessness in her eyes.\nIf left to her own devices, Toddifons might be stuck here until the end of time, but the craftsman had a better solution. He walked up to Toddifons and spoke softly:\n'We have an order to repair the defensive artillery in the city we're mooring in next week. If you have time, you can come and take a look.'",

Apparently the one who betrayed them was a double agent who couldn't tell anyone about it, and every enemy gets redemption and surrenders one by one.'\nThe emotionless Spot continues, 'After the volume you're holding, the plot just falls apart.'\n\nHeavyrain stops crying, her expression gone completely blank upon hearing spoilers far too convoluted for her turbulent emotions.\n'So... the lead protects everyone, and his friend... didn't betray him?'\nHeavyrain slowly shuts the comic.\nIt really is a sloppy plot. So sloppy and trite, her head hurts like a shield just took a whack at her brain.\n\nBut still...\nIt's a story.

        "description": "Upon hearing her mother leave the house, young Gladiia gets up from her bed, calls her lamp alight, and pulls out her vanity handmirror from under her pillow. Not that she would with any regularity be fully awake when the clock rolls over to zero, but tonight, she needs to look at herself. She needs to choose. As other Ægir view her, she is Gladiia, daughter of key Academy of Sciences personnel, winner of all youth competitions, a family girl, a young success story. But in her mirror, Gladiia sees a carbon-based robot, an emotionless form. Her memory begins with her birth mother being infatuated with Ægir affairs and Academy policymaking, her home merely a secondary point of residence, after the Academy's lounge. She once believed her birth mother sought accomplishment from her, and so she compelled herself to relentlessly reach new heights, applying the standards of adults to her young self. But she never was able to pry any form of feedback from her birth mother—no acknowledgement, no criticism, nothing whatsoever. No, her birth mother gave all her time to Ægir, and left not one idle second of one spare minute for her daughter.\nPerhaps it was all an accident that she was raised, and this household had no reason to exist. This was the sort of conclusion Gladiia reached.\nSo, what else but to look for somewhere she can truly call 'home,' Ægir she can truly call 'family.'\nShe has decided. She will seek. She is set to do it.\nShe wants to hear for herself just what kind of case her birth mother might make in a civil court of law.\nGladiia stows away the handmirror, turns off her light, and sinks into rest.\nHer mind swims frantically with planning.\nShe is restless all night.\n......\nGladiia stands before the tremendous standing mirror of the Consul's residence, examining her negligible self in the looking glass. In just a few hours, she will depart the mansion, take to an operating table, and begin the Abyssal Hunter modification surgery. Perhaps, the moment the procedure is over, her dutiful vocation will be as a military commander and not a Technology Consul, and she will take to the battlefield, there becoming a monster with hands drenched in fresh blood. This has completely destroyed any notion of plotting her life's trajectory, and may even end her time then and there. Gladiia has never feared death, nor the giving of her life, but the sumptuous hall she sees in the mirror does make clear to her an aside—she is still teeming with regrets. Some are desires, some are responsibilities, some are promises, and becoming an Abyssal Hunter will render them all forever unfulfilled. If only the surgery could be postponed long enough, if only Ægir could publish the full scope of the plans to her as soon as possible... This is the first time she realizes that she had never had it all firmly in her grasp like she thought. She will lose, and she will never be able to regain.\nGladiia looks around the hall one more time, then returns to her study.\nIn a few hours, she will depart for the Abyssal Hunter experimentation site. Before she does, she has the mansion's smart housekeeping system store two documents.\nOne, her speech to be given upon becoming an Abyssal Hunter.\nOne, a will.\n......\nAfter Gladiia is marooned in a land not of Ægir, she has in the truest sense of the words lost it all. All she has left with her are a bloodridden lance, a still-passable outfit, and a desiccated and scorching eternity. And now, she stands before a pothole filled with fresh water, gazing upon her own reflection, washing the filth and bloodstains from her clothes.\nThe silt comes off with the water easily enough, but the clots of blood on her garments refuse to be washed off. With no option but to brush them by hand, she watches as their hardened forms attain a pellucidity, turn the shade of liquid blood, and run through the seams, dripping to a rest upon the soil. Is it her blood? The Seaborn's blood? Or her fellows' blood? She cannot differentiate. All of a sudden, Gladiia notices something, and she leans close to the hole, carefully examining her neck.\nA tiny scale.\nThough why is a mystery, Gladiia's birth mother comes to her mind in that moment. If she could, she would rather suffer her neglect again. This scale would never have found the chance to rest upon her neck.\nBut it has.\nGladiia stands up, and throws her freshwater-soaked hair behind her in one gesture.\nShe can indeed feel it. There is an embitterment, a discontent inside her. There is no need for these feelings to surface, and they do nothing to help in this present situation.\nShe has indeed lost it all, but she finds she can still afford to uphold her basic honor and dignity, which in turn means she can still move onwards with her head held high.\nShe needs no hope. She simply focuses on possibilities, feasibilities, and results.\nShe can still return to Ægir.\nShe is still alive to recover the Abyssal Hunters, scattered and lost.\nAs long as the probability is not zero, she is still bound to try.\nSo make good on it she shall.\nGladiia wipes her lance's bloodstains dry, and vanishes from the side of the 'hole.'\nSeconds later, the sonic boom jolts the water from the pool, blanketing any and all trace she was ever there.",

        "description": "Sand circles above. In the rays of light, no longer can she trust anything before her.\nVoices call to her. Souls lift her hide-wrought bag, turn her dazedness to weariness.\nShe sees a land without limit, a land rich with life. She feels something tightly grip her hand. She looks back, and in the haze of memory fumbles for her own name.\nKal'tsit.\nShe knows she was born into these ruins of civilization bearing a calling, but there is no one to shine a light on what is to come for her. Ultimately, she cannot live free from this calling. It is akin to taking a meal, or sleeping.\nShe begins to walk, walk upon the lost dust, carefully sorting through her myriad years of memories and knowledge. She sees a new nation rise from yet more ruins. She recalls how the result of her abandonment was deposed royalty. She sees fresh, novel flags howl atop the blood-soaked battlefield. She recalls how both sides of the war united against a common enemy in those ancient times.\nShe sees forests yet thinks of barrens, gazes on mountains yet recollects lakes—she walks through the river that is Time, picking up stones, while the eras surge, parting around her, rushing forward on.\nBut she is immutable. She has no past, and no future either.\nIt takes her a deal of Time before she has her thoughts reorganized. She remembers the last death. The years stretching long enough to see the form of life itself change. Still, she never thought death would be so fast; some things are changing at this very moment.\nLives flourish without rhyme or reason, and the land morphs and fluctuates. Man-made machines operate with a rumble, the radiance of Originium energy shining into the umbra. In the dark, the people struggle, yearning for the light, scorning shadow in an age of brilliance, on and on. Her countenance is concealed by the flurry of grit stirred by a nomadic city, and she feels anxious to the depths of her heart.\nDoes the will that hid the stars behind the false sky still watch the surface recur in its rise and fall? How long until the Terrans, so proud of their thriving civilizations, personally send those same civilizations into the ice-cold void, to join countless lost lives?\nTime is running short. This is what Kal'tsit tells herself. She has fallen to blaming herself. She has wasted too much Time, and at so many moments barely averted the self-destruction of Terra, barely led them to a safe place to develop. It has exhausted her, drained her.\nShe is no omniscient, omnipotent being. And yet, she tasks herself with tending to the entire World.\nHer calling was never a fair one.\nShe has to hurry. She has to do whatever it takes.\nHer gaze comes to rest on a shattered Kazdel. It is far from the first time she's touched on the legend of the Lord of Fiends. In the boundless years, more than once she has thought of retrieving and exploiting this ancient force. She cannot help but stifle her memories of the Teekaz—to make an effort not to long for the bygone days where Originium had not yet molded life into its present form, and not to commemorate a possibility that has long since vanished.\nMaybe this time, it's time she made up her mind.\n......\n...\n'So this was your previous journey, Kal'tsit.'\n'It stretches longer than the fragment you've seen. Thousands and thousands of times longer, Theresa.'\n'But perhaps it's only now I've truly understood you... my enemy.'\n'...I feel the same, King of Sarkaz.'",

Akafuyu doesn't turn around, but simply removes a shoulder guard with one hand and tosses it to Kirara. Her eyesight may be poor, but she's so aware of her surroundings, she might as well have a camera in her back.\n'This armor...'\n'It's an heirloom. It's not valuable. My master doesn't go out to fight much, so it was bequeathed to me.'\n'Um, the design...'\n'It's a very special shape to the armor. In the old days, each family had its own style.'\nKirara touches the shoulder guard and compares it to the armor in her game. She starts to think the developers must know of Akafuyu.\n'Someone asked me almost the same question before, a little girl about your age. She would ask me under her breath, 'Captain, is your armor made of some high-tech material? Can it really withstand a grenade blast?' Ha, she might have thought I was some antique.'\n'So, can it?'\n'Don't be a fool. It's hard, sure, but it's just a piece of metal. You'd do better training hard and listening to your commander. She knew that, of course. Still, this armor has saved me plenty of times. Look, the pit that jumps right out at you there, that crossbow bolt almost pierced clean through my arm. Oh, and she was there in the last battle, standing next to me. Damned near died.'\nKirara suddenly loses interest in the topic.\nThe heavy feeling on her knees reminds her that this shoulder guard is supposed to be unique, representing an era of glory passed from one generation to the next, still thick with the stench of war and sacrifice.\nBut now, it's a rare item in a popular game, and any player can get it, if they pay enough.\nAkafuyu stands up. Kirara decides to hurry over and take out the freshly purchased game disc before Akafuyu notices.\n'By the way, do you have a minute?' Akafuyu walks towards her, 'I just killed the final boss without taking any damage. Can you upload the recording to that forum you like? Oh, and put my name on it, so you-know-who doesn't miss it...'\nKirara only now notices the game on the screen. The main character is holding a wooden sword with the lowest ATK, wearing almost no armor, except... the piece currently resting on her knees.\n'Does it... bother you?'\n'What? Oh, that it's my armor? If someday the people of Higashi know it from a game, rather then from a battlefield... then it can only mean that the war is finally over.' Akafuyu takes back the shoulder guard and slots it neatly into place, 'I've waited too long for that day.'",

The following is a brief rundown of the game.\n\n■ Primer\nWe Will Survive 3 Online is an RPG that includes both competitive and cooperative gameplay. Players will play as and control different characters in-game, raising their survival rank, and battling with other players to win the Survivals.\nOf course, joining forces will also be necessary throughout many points in the game, so this is a game to enjoy with your friends.\n\n■ Controls\nPlayers must use a controller compatible with the console when controlling their chosen character.\nIf you have multiple people playing, have more controllers ready.\n\n■ Items\nAll items within the game can be obtained either through exploring the wild or through crafting.\nOnce obtained, items can be stored in your backpack. Backpack space is limited, so you can trade any items you don't need at the moment with your friends in-game, and you can opt to just send them as gifts too.\nEach item you collect also unlocks its illustration in the guidebook. If you want to unlock them all and unlock the secret achievement, get trading with players!\n\n■ Competition Phase\nDon't forget, your ultimate goal is victory in the Survivals!\nMerry cooperation goes hand-in-hand with the struggle to compete afterwards! Use your survival skills to contest and loot other players' resources. Out in the wild, you can also lie in ambush, or directly challenge people, initiating one-on-one battles with other players!\nThe higher a player's survival rank, the bigger the advantage in the fight! Decide who amongst you will be the champion of the Survivals!\n\nWith that, you should now have a decent understanding of the game. Invite your friends, plunge into a colorful world, and have a fun time playing together!",

The child began to think.\nHe would like to mend the castle, and continue his life from before.\nBut after the witch was gone, suppose the castle were to fall apart again; whatever would he do?\n\nHe thought and thought, until finally a perfect wish came to him:\n—I want to take the castle with me, away from the forest.\n\nHence, the child set upon the journey of his—\nAnd behind him was his tiny little castle, which seemed to look very much like him, and which forever protected him.\n\n—The Child's Castle, selected from The Jeffreys Collection of Fairytales New and Old",

        "description": "When Indigo was still newly arrived on Rhodes Island, we conducted a study on her staff. The unit at its head seemed to be the key to its function, but we could find no clear theory underpinning it. During further studies, new Operators Irene and Lumen—who had visited Engineering to undergo equipment certification—coincidentally passed by, and the latter took one look at Indigo's staff and very confidently told us that he had seen something similar in the 'Eye of Iberia.' The 'Eye of Iberia' is a lighthouse... a series of lighthouses along Iberia's coastal towns, a grand project that once illuminated the whole nation, abandoned altogether after a disaster decades ago, and now a legacy of the age. Indigo's teacher was one of those very lighthouse keepers, and it was he who gave her the staff as she left home.\n'The unit at her staff's head is a standard installation in Iberia's lighthouse systems.' This much should be more or less accurate. The issue was that, based on her account, her teacher protected the Rocky Coast's lighthouse all his life, hoping it would one day shine anew. So why would he give her something so important and then allow her to leave?\nIndigo herself had this to say: 'I'm sure my teacher wanted me to gain some experience on the outside, unravel the secret of its technology, and let it come to life once again... He really was mindful!'\nMeanwhile, Irene stated: 'Will Iberia's lighthouses never shine again without those Ægir relics? Iberia's prosperity should be left up to the Iberians themselves this time.'\nIndigo and Irene's answers undoubtedly represent two different outlooks held by the modern Iberian on the nation's future, and deserve some consideration. However, once they had both left, Lumen raised an alternative, 'small-minded' conjecture, more or less that before an old man sends his granddaughter off to the city, he stuffs the only valuable they own into her suitcase and hopes she'll never come back, or that he'll have passed by the time she does... or thereabouts.\n'The elderly are like that. They like to decide everything for you while you're still clueless,' Lumen added.\nSpeculating on an old man's intentions seemed unnecessary. Besides, having ascertained the history of her Arts unit, our investigation into Indigo was complete. And, of course, it would never have affected how welcome she is at Rhodes Island. But we will note that upon learning the staff's origins, Indigo went blank for a moment. As for what thoughts she had in that instant, and what decisions she made, we have no way of knowing.",

We stand here and gaze as far as the eye may see, to the land covered by the radiance of the moons. All is our home.\nThe mountain spring flows forth from here, crosses untold hills, sweeps untold grasslands, and finally flows into the lake of the Aegean Plains, to become one with the blood of us all.\nWe owe it to our shared language, our shared folksong, our shared beliefs, that we stand here, to expel our common enemy. After tonight, so too will our blood unite.\nHERO: Let us drink together from a ladle of this spring water, and as we return in victory, we may then drink together from the mead this spring water creates.\n(The HERO, together with every FOLLOWER, imbibes wine. Timmy is still not of age. Please give him ginger ale instead.)\nHERO: I imagine we all, when we were born of this land and first opened our eyes, saw that our soil was ravaged by lowly intruders, and that our first wail was mingled with the invaders' satisfied jeers.\nWe have never seen the great and peaceful days spoken of in the epics, but we've no iota of doubt that this land we call Minos was of much different impression a century ago.\n(Performers begin to play here, growing gradually impassioned as the lyrics progress.)\n(Choir dances, and pairs off with Originium Arts.)\nHERO: Beneath the warm sunshine, the people contested in military fashion, yet did not endanger their lives, but simply tempered their wills and physiques; the crossing of words was not for epithets of hate, but for the pursuit of this land's deepest secrets.\nThe forests were not places to lay treacherous ambush, for Heria's thickets were of a different image in the verses; the rivers served as more than a channel to break the enemy front, for in them we could bathe and sing loud.\nHERO: The rose has need of the thorn's protection, and the beauty of our poems likewise ask for blade and shield to guard them. And we can use their petals to adorn our armor, and see their verses meld with our songs of war.\nHERO: Behold, for the moons are at their peak. Our victory in this war is as clear as this night sky. I believe it.\n(Turn lighting up to maximum.)\nHERO: Warriors, heroes, sharpen your weapons for the very last time.\nThe withered trees will turn to nourishment that feeds this land, and the ruins of the wild will become as foundations for our rebuilt splendor.\nTonight, we take back our faith, and we take back both the history and future of Minos.\n(The HERO raises their sword, and all FOLLOWERS pick up their weapons and line up. Choir chants. Curtains.)\n(Pay attention to number of weapons when inventorying props. DO NOT let real weapons get mixed in.)\n—From the third act of the Theater of Akroti's 'Light of Heria'.

I watched as those bandits bared their vice. I hold myself in contempt for this inaction of mine. Even if it was to ensure a qualified test subject, to probe at the possibilities for humanity.\nI'm sure the child became aware in time that I could have saved everyone, but one as smart as him has no need to seek answers from me. Yes, he is smart and studious, but he has no reverence for knowledge, nor does he treat it as a simple tool. He seems an uninvolved bystander, examining all he witnesses. Perhaps this is the reason he did not lose himself in his bond to the Herald's flesh. Were he of different birth, he may well have been a scholar of his own school.\nOriginally, no change seemed to occur in the child's body, to the extent I doubted my own research, thereafter deciding to prolong my observation of him. This lasted until he finally found that group of bandits, and cut the flesh from himself to give to them, inquiring if it was their lives plagued of hunger that led them to do evil, and if upon being ensured a life of warmth and plenty they could renounce that evil—\nI thought this child would have long since vanished everyone.

That's why they bear seeds and allow themselves to decay and return to the soil to nourish their offspring, rather than permanently hoarding all the nutrients they take in. This is not an act of pity, but an act of hope.\nNow, if we expand this context to the entire ecosystem, rather than confining ourselves to a specific species, what happens? All living things help each other, cultivate the land and the sea, making the entire planet more abundant and creating a better living environment for ourselves and future generations. Yes, the possibility of this outcome is equally present in every last ordinary seed.\n...\nThat's what the plan should have been, prior to certain unexpected events.",

The match is about to begin, and she's still not back yet? \nThis is quite unfortunate. Being late to her debut match will surely leave a bad taste in the fans' mouths. This certainly won't do any favors for Miss Valentine's future career! \nAnd in addition to that, she's going to need to personally look over her custom equipment, and if she's not here... \nHuh?

Is that... somebody playing the flute? \n\nThe soft melody of the flute was gently carried along the wind, far, far away. \nEver higher, ever further away. \nThe wind continued to blow, to the place I promised to return to. \nPlease, take this tune back with you. \nPlease tell everyone. \nThat Justyna has finally become a knight. \nBut don't tell anyone. \nThat Justyna sorely misses her home. \n\n......\n......My goodness, how long have I been here?! \nI shouldn't be spacing out like that!

I've almost filled up the wastebasket with scrapped drafts at this point. In the end, I think that cliche is the only thing I can really write.\n\nThis is the first time in my life I'm writing a letter to a hero of mine. You said during an interview that you read every single letter from your supporters, and I know you wouldn't lie!\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on getting the title 'Fartooth,' it's so incredibly cool! I was there for your match with Feather Knight, the sight of you winning without any backup at all touched all of us there! It's only right you were #1 in the season!\nEver since I first saw a match of yours three years ago, I got really into you as a knight. You might not remember, but I was sat in the front row of the grandstand, and the knight who was against you slipped up with a move and almost hurt the audience, but then you blocked it even though you were injured. Among the people you saved, the ones behind you, were me and my family.\nEver since then, you've been an inspirational figure for me. You're a true knight, Ms. Justyna, I'm surer of that than anything. I was still a student then, and if I studied good enough and my grades got better, my family would reward me by taking me to see your matches. I could say you were the one who gave me the drive to keep heading forwards.\n\nI want to become a glorious knight like you so much! Knights would never point their arrowheads at the defenseless, and I don't believe you'd ever use violence against any Knightclub's fans!\nThe 'Fartooth' Knight Justyna I know doesn't concede even when she's hurt, and never talks down to other knights even in the arena. I, along with your other supporters, don't believe any of that slander against you, so please don't take those irresponsible newspaper reports to heart! We're all looking forward to you returning as soon as you can!\nAlso, when I heard you say you wanted to start your own Knightclub, I was over the moons! You always ran solo in the past, and sometimes you looked sort of lonely, so it made me and a lot of other fans really worried... In the end, whether you start your own Knightclub, join another one, or stay active as an independent knight, we'll always support you as long as it's your decision, Ms. Justyna!\nWe hope everything goes well for you!\n\nYour faithful supporter",

As usual, her opponent momentarily leaves an opening for her, and she seizes the opportunity and thrusts forward with her swordstaff.\n'Well done, Margaret.' Schnitz Nearl falls to the ground, pretending to be helpless, lying there as he smiles and shows his daughter a thumbs-up. \n'Father...'\nSince she began her combat training, Margaret has rarely landed a blow on the man.\nBut this time...\n'Did, did I do it right?'\n'You did. You did a great job, Margaret.'\n'Do you think you can help me up now?'\n'S-Sure. I'm sorry, Father.' Margaret hurriedly sets down her swordstaff and grabs her father's hand with both of hers, using all her strength to pull him off the ground. \n'A good showing, young foal. Now even your father is no match for you.'\nMargaret's mother, Yolanta, appears at the training area's entrance carrying Maria, who is still a baby, in a swaddle blanket.\n'Haha, you should've seen how much momentum she had behind that last thrust.'\n\n'Mother, what brings you here?' \nIt is late at night, but Margaret sees that her mother is neatly-dressed and carrying a suitcase, as if getting ready to go out.\n'It's almost time, Schnitz. Put yourself together.'\n'Alright, give me five minutes.'\nThe father takes off his training pads, revealing the suit of armor underneath.\n'Mother, Father, where are you going?'\n'I'm sorry, my child, but we can't tell you.'\n'Just imagine we're heading up north to buy you some souvenirs.'\n'A-Are you going to be gone for a long time?'\n'Yes...' Margaret's father is deep in thought for a moment. 'It might take a bit of time.'\n'So, can we ask you for a little favor, Margaret?'\n'I'm listening, Mother. I promise I'll do whatever I can!'\n'First of all...' the mother squats down and hands the sleeping Maria to the young girl. 'I'll need you to take care of your little sister and your grandpa.'\nThough Maria was not heavy at the time, when Margaret held her, she gripped her carefully for fear that her sister would fall from her arms.\n'If you have any questions about combat techniques, you can ask your uncle. He has much more experience than your father does.'\n'Yes, Father...'\n......\n'Is there anything else you want to say?'\n'That's about it.'\nKnock, knock, knock––\nSomeone is at the door.\nShe feels each knock pounding at her heart, striking her with fear.\nHer parents are about to leave.\nHer father readies his swordstaff, and her mother readies her bow. Margaret follows them to the door.\nWhen it opens, two campaign knights in silver armor stand before them.\nTo Margaret, they look like a pair of man-eating monsters.\n'Lord Schnitz, Lady Yolanta, we have instructions to escort you out of the Grand Knight Territory.\nThe parents agree in hushed voices, then turn back to Margaret.\nSchnitz hugs Margaret and Maria tightly.\nYolanta leaves a heavy kiss on their cheeks.\nMargaret stands in the doorway, watching her parents' figures grow fainter and fainter.\nThe whole time, she expected her parents to suddenly turn back to tell her it was all a prank.\nShe expected her uncle, who had watched her parents depart from outside the door, would go bring them back to the warmth of their family. \nShe even expected her sickly grandfather upstairs to rush down and drive away the troublemaking campaign knights.\nBut her expectations were dashed.\nHer pride and her sunlight slowly disappeared to the edge of the Grand Knight Territory, never to be seen again.\nMargaret feels an emptiness inside.\nAll she can do is close the door behind her and hug her sister tightly.\nNothing more.",

And maybe, some time next year, the pinecones that fell intact would find a completely new life in the ash-blanketed earth... just as she did.\nShe had to live on, in the stead of her friends and family who lost their lives to Catastrophe. She had to plant roots and bud in the soil they named Kazimierz. Such notions kept her driven to the present day.\nBut before she knew it, Sona was shaking her head free of them all. They skipped too many steps—they would only trap her in more regrettable circumstances. She couldn't go on like this. She had to learn to be optimistic. Shape up her act, and perhaps the merchants would give her an out, and employ this little Infected girl to do what handiwork she could.\nSoon after, she learned from newspapers and television that Infected, too, could be knights. She was going to find a way in. Still, she wanted to become one just so she could make a living. With no chivalric spirit of old turned life lesson, and no grand visions or hopes, Sona clenched her fist tight.\nBut the next thing she knew, she was being forced to raise it against fellow Infected who deserved it just as little.\nSona wasn't strong, but she was nimble. She stood out amongst the Infected for it, and was selected by the bankroller of an underground power and sent into the 'cleaning qualifiers.' No weapon in hand, danger surrounding her, and a single fist planted in her foe's face. And they toppled, and Sona won the right to survive another day—but she wasn't happy. She wasn't strong. Taking her opponent down in one blow... it could only be because they were starving, because the evening before, their backer 'tipped' a few knights some bonds to get into a brawl with them.\nSona wasn't happy. She wasn't strong.\nSome fawned, telling her if she just dressed up a little, she'd be so cute, so lovely and sweet. Some gushed, telling her if she just went through some proper training, she'd be a terror of the racetrack.\nUntil one voice told her: 'You've got a tail like a blazing fire.' It caught her off guard.\nThere was nothing in particular beneath that statement, and it was no more than an ordinary spectator, reveling in the violence, who yelled it.\nBut it was the first time Sona had ever choked with emotion after a match.\nYes. She'd just realized it. She ought to be like a blazing fire.",

No child at that point in the Krukowska family was as gallant as her, and she became the knight they placed their hopes in.\nIwona was used to long-term life in the camp. Scarce on modern means of entertainment, she upheld the strictest work-rest cycle and physical training, all of it for one purpose, becoming a campaign knight—the bravest campaign knight of them all.\nTo the Krukowska family, attaining service as a campaign knight is the highest honor of them all. The ancient family defends at the borderlands, their backs to the prosperous clamor of Kazimierz's cities, facing the frostbitten winters of Ursus. Iwona grew up on stories of heroism, and grew a pure fear and longing for that dangerous, tumultuous battlefield like nothing else.\nThe day her family Knight Primus granted her the chalice, it ensured Iwona had no second thoughts. She beat pure hot blood with every pulse. She signed up to every arduous training regimen with no care for the risk, and improved herself through it. She never took notice of whatever grimy deals and nonsense slander laid behind those majestic ideals. She...\nShe ran too fast, forgot precautions were always called for in perilous circumstances, and just one negligent second would be all it took to brew a tremendous tragedy.\nIwona only forgot this one thing. Just one time.\nShe was mercilessly thrown to the ground in the open country. A lone person hurrying, a lone person wounded, a lone person helpless. Those wild beasts growing Originium crystals wailed at her in their death throes, piercing her eardrums. Those sharp Originium crystals, sent every way by the explosion, skewered a body that wouldn't move as she asked.\nMaking it on willpower until aid came running, Iwona was lucky to survive. But after that, she was thoroughly cut away from the life she used to live.\nThat chalice was placed in her display cabinet, separated by a glass door, and every time Iwona came home, she would wipe it clean.\nShe tried returning to her family afterwards, to at least see her own mother and father again one more time, go back into her room, take away some memories of hers—\nNot once more has she set foot through that heavy wooden door.",

The founding of trade enclaves represents the first time in a century the Sami have opened borders, Columbian caravans and corporate engineer teams becoming frequent guests at Sami's frontier. Ever since she was young, Pudding's frequently gone with her parents to Sami, headed for that ancient land. \nIce and snow blanket the earth wide, sunshine spilling over and refracting, as if a realm paved full with gems. But this is only one corner of Sami. \n'On the tundras of Sami far from civilization, in the forever hibernal Fjal Vetrtonn, most Sami by far still carry on their millennium-old ancient way of life. They're far removed from the Columbian enclave, indifferently surveying all from the Fjal Vetrtonn and bone-chilling winds. Time freezes upon their skin,' says the Sarkaz owner of the coffee shop. 'Don't you want to go deeper and see? See the sights of those tundras and mountains, how the Sami get along with nature in the wilderness.' \n'Am I allowed to?' Pudding hesitantly asks. 'I'm not sure if they'd welcome a city person like me...' \n'Sami does not defy its own fate. We know what it faces, and know how it will respond.' \nAnd so Pudding signs up to join a local supporting construction project, departing early morning one day, going with the team of Columbian engineers into the Myrkwood that she once only gazed at from afar. \nIn the primordial woods, the Sami steadfastly distance from modern technology. Only one subset, a wetland settlement near to the autonomous region, is willing to receive the Columbian engineers' help. \nConstructing a base station, connecting cables, turning on the village's first bulbs... Pudding stares at the faint lights, and the grin of satisfied wonderment on some Sami faces, and it suddenly hits her just what technology means to these people. \nBut it's only in places more remote still, where the true secrets of the Sami lie, a land the Columbians cannot pry into. \nPudding's vacation will be over very soon. She writes up her experiences in the village into a report, and puts it inside her suitcase, ready to take it back to Columbia. \nI'll come back again very soon, she thinks happily. \nYet because of one accident, this hope, ordinary by all rights, spends a long, long time delayed, before she can make good on it.",

That little yellow flower! I never knew flowers that pretty could grow in the extreme north, all the way in the ice deserts! It's unbelievable, really.\nYou suggested I should 'join the next exploration project as a supporting surveyor,' right? I've given serious thought to it. Not whether to go or not—I still have to stay on the landship at this stage so I can get Oripathy treatment. It's what help I would be if I did go. Mayer's said how under extreme cold conditions, your Soaring Dragon drones get their stability affected. I minored in research filming while I was studying at Ironforge Polytechnic, so I tried installing a set of production lenses on my shield, so it could handle photography and data storage roles at certain temperatures. I should be able to take my shield through more special terrain, compared to using drones, and use it for fundamental defense work. It can sort out the issue of stability, too.\n......\nMaggy, I admire you, with all my heart. While everyone only has the barest imagining of what such faraway places are like, you've gone deep into them, gotten a taste of all this fascinating scenery, felt the pulse of life. I once went with a survey group into the northern icefields and saw the aurora, and that was when I learned a really important lesson in life: not every place has snowy peaks like Kjerag, and protection like Kjeragandr's, but every place has its own beauty you can't explain with common sense. The Black Flow forests, the Ringed Plains with mountains all around... all these extreme landscapes have nothing to do with the supernatural, really. They're part of Terra in themselves. I can't help but wonder, just how—shallow and narrow everything we know and hear and think and believe about this great land is.\nI want to see the aurora again more than anything else. I want to go and see the ice deserts. Not so I can prove anything—just because, well, 'I want to go and see.' Master SilverAsh is write. If we want to protect Kjerag, then we have to know just what kind of world it is we live in.\nWe can only better defend the homeland behind us if we're brave enough to explore onward. And besides, I have this sort of feeling, like the ice deserts, the poles, all these places full of hidden secrets far away already have a lot of eyes watching them... \nSo once I'm ready, Maggy, you can be sure I'll submit my application to the Doctor.\n......\nI eat... a little bigger, and I sleep more as well, but you don't need to worry, I promise. When it comes work time, I'll get down to it, believe me. I'm sure I'll be able to help you out.\n\n—Extract from comms logs sent to Operator Magallan by Operator Aurora",

Beyond it is a nomadic city, its night as bright as the day. \n'This wind––' \n'What about it?'  \n'I'm not sure how to describe it right now.' \n'Even the great wordsmith, Ling, has times when she's lost for words?' \n\nThe wind first passes through the eaves of the garden, swirling around the head of the willow tree. Its power largely spent, it brushes against Ling's face, as if scratching an itch. \n'The company of friends, endless cups of wine. The warm wind brings me––'\n'I flipped through your recent poems...' A sudden voice rings out. \n'Brother...' \n'Warm wind, fragrant wind, easterly wind, lotus wind, willow wind, wind across the bridge, wind beneath the fan... Why don't you try going somewhere without wind for a change?' \n'Is there any place in this world that doesn't host any wind?' \nShe can't remember how many poetry meetings she has attended recently - pretty much the same gardens, the same meandering water, the same thousand cups of liquid you couldn't get drunk on, the same hundred poems, the same charming emotions. To make merry is fine indeed, but it is too easy to make merry. \n'There may be a place that needs you more... somewhere that'll let you compose new poems.' \n\nIn order to control its only water source, this mobile city does not rely on the mountains as a barrier, but rather stands on the vast desert, like a lonely giant in an unfathomably vast world with nobody else to rely on. The great wind rouses, occasionally kicking up rough sand and dust that passes across one's cheeks like daggers. \n It's not as if there's no wind here - it's just not that same kind of wind. The mountain's sanctuary is distant, the spring wind's breath expired. \nLing stares at the meadow but a stone's throw away, where the last of the remaining elite soldiers lay, their armor covered in wet spikes. Three whole battalions, yet the meadow at night is nothing but a meadow. \nAn ambush took place here. The city that rouses the night was the bait, while the meadow was the trap. \n'Light the torches brighter.' \n'They're already bright enough to attract those guys.' \n'It is for the soldiers beneath the meadow to see. War comes soon, and none shall return. Nobody can resist the urge to turn around and look. Burn them brighter, and they shall become the lights of their hometowns.' \nThe great wind cannot extinguish the flames in the meadow, the men's eyes fix upon their homes through the night. \n\nA cold wind blows, the senses stir. Her eyes open to the depths of Shancheng's night. Empty jars of Husong wine fill the pavilion, a half-written poem on the page in front of her.",

But the worst thing is, there's a farmers' market to the west... Tch.' \n 'What's wrong with a farmers' market?'\n  'It reeks of death.' \n 'Indeed, it all makes sense! You are a true master!' The client leans over to Lee and looks at the compass. The disk's surface is like a mirror, a frowning face reflected within it. \n'The qi of all things heaven and earth are not in alignment. When the qi is in harmony, auspice is invited. When the qi is in disharmony, evil is invited. That this house fails to be in alignment in every direction means it is a cursed house. Stay here for too long, and I'm afraid that business aside, the owner of this house will...' \n 'Master, Master! You must help me!' \n 'Don’t panic. You are my very first client in Lungmen, and it appears that the two of us will share a bond. I'll send you an after-sale service today - if you move out within three days, I will find another place for you. I'll take care of this house for you.' \n 'Thank you so much, Master! Thank you!'  \n\n 'And that's how you rented this house for less than half its original price?' \n Later, when Lee told this story to the three youths at the dinner table, Hung clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, Aak was rolling on the floor, and Waai Fu was staring intently at the boss, as if at a swindler. \n 'Can you really get Feng Shui from a compass?' \n Lee took a sip of tea and brought out the compass, the three kids gathering around him. Reflected on its surface are three curious noggins. \n 'That guy opened a remodeling business, but all the buildings in the area were recently-built and newly furnished. Where was he going to get his business? I didn't swindle anyone.'",

I thought she was going to chew me out too, but instead she gave me some cake.\nShe must've seen how down I was feeling. But I did mess up, that's a fact. I saw a teammate ahead to my left who hadn't noticed the danger behind him, so I went to go help him. I acted without warning, and didn't expect to get hit by a training bolt. I caused the mission to fail right then and there. The instructors said no one should be making such a basic mistake. I was so embarrassed.\n'Shh. This is from my secret stash~'\nI nodded and gave a bite. It was sweet and creamy, with roasted apple slices on top, and—wrapped chocolates inside?!\n'I was gonna put something in there that'd break your teeth right off, but seeing how you were on the verge of tears, I switched it for chocolate, see?'\nKroos unwrapped one and popped it into her mouth, then unwrapped another for me. We sat on the bench next to the door to the Training Room, and she told me all sorts of things. How she'd made her own mistakes—ones just like mine today—how she'd gotten into massive arguments with her teammates over a disagreement in the field, how she had all these pranks of hers, and how she'd remodeled her crossbow.\nAnd at the very end, I'd finished the cake, and put the chocolate in my bag. Kroos patted me on the head and said, 'You're going to remember today's lesson, aren't you?'\n'I just thought, if I'd seen it but didn't help, I'd regret it...'\nShe gave me a serious look. 'If something does happen for real, regret'll just be part and parcel. Training helps us not make the same mistakes in real combat.' She tossed a toy at me, some kind of prank thing again. 'Use this to give that other operator of yours a fright!'\n'But don't tell anyone I've been stashing the sweet stuff again!'\nA long while later, I'd finally become a formal operator, and I made the correct decision in a crisis. Nobody was even hurt. In a rush of glee, I couldn't help but think of that day, of Kroos's cake and the things she told me.\nI sought her out after I returned to the landship, and once she'd finished taking in my combat report, she showed me something. It was a thick, dense file, with line after line of planned adjustments for the training equipment's trigger timing, and how every Reserve Operator would respond. All in her handwriting.\n'Less regrets this way,' she laughed. 'You did great.'",

She'd never had the finest control over firearms, though the Sankta her age used guns as naturally as their own limbs.\n'Fia. I'm not going to say 'it's just a racial gulf' or whatever to try to comfort you, and I'm not going to proclaim that wielding guns is a Sankta-exclusive glory, like SOME cardinals. Practice will yield results, and you've as good as brushed shoulders with those results, even if it's not gone how you'd want.'\n'But there's still a different way, or maybe you could say a different TOOL that could help you move forward. This box holds something one of my mechanics tutors left to me. He's not coming back to Laterano, ever. He violated the law.'\n'But, child, law is not our everything. Now don't look at me like that—yes, you might go 'big whoop,' but nobody would say our everything ends at food and water either, right? They're just things we're forced to rely on to survive. There's always something that transcends the law, sits beyond it, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. Some call it righteousness, some call it sensibility, and some call it a vague hope.'\n'Don't panic, and don't worry. There will be times when wanting to do something will make you unstoppable.'\n......\nThe Liberi is no longer a girl; she's been more places than can be imagined, and seen more sights than can be believed, but afternoons in Laterano will never change. The sun is as fine and beautiful as ever.\nThese two weapons have been by her side for longer than can be described; they have ensured her safety through danger, and mercilessly shot down the absurd aspirations of others.\nShe carefully cleans the grime from her old friends, oils them, inspects the pressure in every last piece of ammo, and affirms again and again their ordering by type. She'll soon face her pursuer, her enemy of eight years, and there's no such thing as being overly prepared.\nThere is always something that transcends the law.\nThere's no vengeance in her heart, and no pity either. Only this: what must be settled will be settled, and those who must bear the cost will pay the price. She understands—this is an obsession, nothing more.\nShe slots the final shell into her magazine.",

Family, loyalty, freedom, future, she has no clear awareness of any of it at that age. She just grits her teeth and endures training too ruthless in some measures for a child, and in her wide eyes gleams light—she wants to be what her strongest senpais are, reach the top, offer her loyalty to the lord.\nBut she doesn't know what 'offer her loyalty' means. She just knows it's an honor, it's what her parents and herself want to do, so she has to do it.\n\nA Kazemaru no longer cleaning the mud from her head again seeks out the young lord.\nShe has become the lord's shinobi. Her hair is bound beneath her hat, her nails orderly trimmed, and missions arrive secretly one after another from the bamboo tubes into her hands. Kazemaru pulls out the scroll inside, and silently looks over. The name she has no recognition of written at the top of that scroll is about to silently lose everything he originally possessed, all before a single fowl is startled.\n'Well done.'\nSo the lord often commends her, but while in hiding, she hears a mother in another courtyard scolding her crying child: 'Keep crying, and the people in black will take you away!'\n\nThe young lord looks at his employee whose head is covered in mud.\nShe changes out of the black bodysuit, and will no longer receives scrolls in bamboo tubes. The old lord has passed, and Kazemaru has a new outfit.\nThe meeting room isn't secret, but it's cramped and inaccessible; contracts fly back and forth in the open, but it's all too smooth and steady. As the days wear on, Kazemaru flexes her stiffened spine at her office desk, joints chafing with a 'krrk,' and the last time she heard that noise, it was like a hidden weapon scraped at her bones.\nShe doesn't like sitting, nor becoming one of the 'people in black' which that mother had tried to spook her child with.\nThis isn't what she's meant to do. This isn't what she likes to do. She wants to do actual good work. She doesn't want to neglect her skills like this. She wants a new way out, but she still hasn't found the full resolve to take the step.\n\nThe young lord reaches out, brushes away the grime caking Kazemaru's pale hair, and hands her a contract termination, along with a business card for Rhodes Island.\nOne time when returning from work, an unsteady flowerpot was blown into the air, crumbs of soil and leaf fragments flying out to form a graceful arc, and the planter compacted with soil plummeted down and crashed straight onto Kazemaru's head.\nHead covered in soil and ceramic chips, Kazemaru was struck awake—she needed to leave. She had to leave.",

They did not save you alone.\nAs if she had heard her Maestro pass judgment on her, she let out a great breath, and for the first time conceded her loss.\n\n'High Inquisitor Dario's darling disciple'—as many people came to speak of her later on.\nIf the proper verdict is not written in the Scriptures, then it must come from her Maestro's mouth.\nShe was so firm of faith, yet could never pass evaluation.\nUntil one time, she involuntarily blurted out a judicial opinion contrary to her Maestro.\nHer Maestro repealed her verdict, but gave her a nod to see.\n\n'Inquisitor Irene'—so she frequently proclaimed herself, from the day she was formally appointed by the Inquisition.\nHer Maestro spoke that she had to make her own judgments.\nShe turned through the past archives again and again, sped to scenes of greatest danger one after another, and within a few brief years, she had resolved close to a hundred cases.\nEach time she reported her verdicts to her Maestro, he would refuse to comment.\nUntil they bade farewell on the shore of Gran Faro, and she confronted the ocean alone and the menace it delivered.\nThe Scriptures, the Maestro, and the Self.\nAll wills merged as one in the face of true danger, becoming the fire that blazes forth from her handcannon.\n\n'Irene, Inquisition Messenger of Iberia.'\nSo the dainty Liberi introduced herself aboard Rhodes Island.\nShe still proudly lifts her head.

The only thing she needs to do is let herself relax, place herself into the best possible state to be thrown into the next mission, the next battle.\nThe record is a masterpiece of the Iberian Golden Age, bought by her off an Iberian operator's hands.\nSpecter closes her eyes, lets herself sink into the sofa, and enjoys it in stillness.\nShe couldn't tell you a thing about what accomplishments marked Iberia's Golden Age, but she can sense from the music the splendor of that age, and how its people must have been so proud of their successes.\nIt's not godawful at all, she concedes.\nShe never masks her disdain for the glories of dry land's culture, but she has no intents of applying that prejudice to the arts—\nYes. Prejudice.\nShe even admits as much to the Doctor, while continuing on her merry way.\nBut her insistence isn't without meaning.\nBesides, she believes that while her and the Captain seem to have it in common, there's actually quite the distinction.\nThe Captain's arrogance comes from that good old Captain purview of Chief Designer. But she—she thinks—she doesn't care where her power comes from, and she's passionate about what undertakings she has these days. But still, sometimes she can't help but wonder—how has that statue in her hometown ended up? How about her hometown itself?\nThe music comes to a crackling halt.\nLaurentina opens her eyes, and what gradually seeps into view is her familiar ceiling. She knows, terrifyingly, she'll get even more used to this environment in time. She's not panicked about it. In order to panic in a new environment, you need to not want to leave the old one, but she's practically forgotten just how her life in Ægir felt to live.\nFrom the record box she now pulls a sawblade, and gently wipes over it, swapping for a new record to continue playing all the while. Maybe, just as the Iberians used all the methods under the sun to record their Golden Age, she can try and get back into her once most beloved activity—sculpting.\nHer one stroke of luck: she might just be stuck away from home for a good while longer. She still has enough time to remember how it looked, she thinks, with no lack of self-mocking irony.",

        "description": "'It is as if slaughtering those overgrown cuts of meat has become our unignorable, even our one-and-only, calling.'\nThe clock ticks and tocks. The dreadnought obstructs the rays as they come down from the dome. Ulpianus lifts his head and fixes his eyes on the flickering indicator lights, as if in thought.\n'It ought not be,' the young female Consul replies, following a long hesitation.\n'Of course it ought not. When an Ægir wakes, the first thought that enters their mind should not be of what they've lost, never. Nor of how to take back what they've lost.' Ulpianus is silent for a juncture, some kind of emotion flowing about his raspy throat. After a good while, he sighs, 'Oh, how many magnificent works we once made.'\n'And now, the battle to survive has become the only to-do list that this new generation knows.'\n'Battle. A glorious word, to be sure. And yet, our outstanding creativity and pursuit of beauty have been all but forgotten.'\nThe two simultaneously gaze afar. Lights dazzle beneath the dome.\n'...Not by choice.' Ulpianus adds.\nGladiia shoots a glance at Ulpianus, mulls over the wording for a moment, then speaks inquisitively: 'You were never the type to be so receptive to sentimentality.'\n'Indeed.' Ulpianus does not halt this time. 'We should address this matter solemnly. Our culture is in the midst of being permanently altered by these protracted days of calamity.'\nA colossal rumbling cuts short Gladiia's pregnant pause. More ships are entering port, a new fleet of migration and reconstruction, and she is left to ponder in earnest what Ulpianus has said. Over the pursuit of beauty, over the creation of the new. Before she was born, or perhaps earlier than that... centuries ago? Millennia? When the Ægir founded this stark and grand culture—did they imagine that now, its radiance would be so dull?\nDid they make any preparations for the present day?\nGladiia's thoughts are lost for but an instant. To her, the past is of unimportance. More vital are what preparations she is soon to make, what things she <<i>>can</i> do.\n'A new Abyssal Hunter.' Ulpianus unceremoniously breaks the silence. 'I hear she previously had quite an interest in the arts. Ballet, opera, she's dabbled in it all.'\n'Laurentina has mentioned a rather profound recollection of the sculpture in her hometown.'\n'Then she still retains some of the essence what all Ægir should have by rights.' Ulpianus turns around. The Consul's light attire for the season cannot conceal his body scarred by experimentation. 'What is she like? If she truly is an epitome of Ægir life from days gone by, then being forced away from the proper course of things must fill her with so much hate.'\n'No. Such sentimentality is but a small supplement to her whole.'\nGladiia breaks into a rare smile. This, despite how her smiles always took careful observation and judgment, on the muscular and nervous levels.\n'She creates a beauty of her own through battle. One of the sorts you speak of, with great exuberance.'\nUlpianus makes a light and noncommittal harrumph in response, after which he soon leaves Gladiia by herself under those gigantic shadows to appreciate the serenity.\nThe grand hall echoes with only the sounds of the Ægir's footsteps forward.",

Jordi had carefully chosen his position, and watching from this angle at sunset, the sinking sun in the west would line up with the tip of the lighthouse for the briefest moment, like this tiny little lighthouse too had come alight.\nRegrettably, it was a fleeting scene, and in the span of a few short breaths, the lighthouse statue would once again go out. Everything about it would be rapidly shrouded in shadow, engulfed by darkness. What he had just witnessed was much like an illusion, gone without a trace.\nFortunately, the sun would rise as it did before the next day, and the lighthouse would come alight again. Just for a moment, of course.\nOn the day of his ninth birthday, Jordi decided to do something big. He wanted to grab hold of something more lasting. He'd try and see for himself what the town's elder workers were so proud of yet kept so secret, see for himself the colossal structure the parents he'd never met had disappeared in, see for himself that true 'Eye of Iberia.' Jordi began to climb the statue in the plaza, believing as long as he stood on its top, he'd be able to see the true rays of the lighthouse piercing through the fog. He clambered inch by inch, hearing the passersby in the plaza shrieking frantically, but the top was right there before him, he just had to make one final leap...\nJordi suddenly felt himself falling—the protrusion he'd used as footing likely crumbled—but why he was falling was no longer important. Jordi had struggled so he could cast his sight far away. Even if it was only for a split-second, he wanted to see it.\nNothing. There was nothing. The fog was like a gauze, covering all upon the surface of the sea.\nWhen Jordi came to, he was already back at home, his leg bandaged, the scent of meat porridge pervading the room. Hearing the sound of Jordi turning over, Thiago poked his body out of the kitchen. Jordi thought he'd be in for a ferocious scolding, but Thiago simply stared at him for a moment, let out a sigh, and pointed in the direction of the desk. There was laid a spyglass, glittering in alluring bronze.\nThat was a bygone affair, years and years ago, and now the scar has even faded. Only the small town's plaza seems to have been overlooked by time, resting unchanged. Jordi sits in his younger self's most favorite spot. Now he's seen the true Eye of Iberia, yet he can no longer sit on this bench with his uncle, listening to those heart-racing stories, taking turns at the spyglass through which they'd gaze far away.\nBut even with the help of a spyglass, they still couldn't see anything. It was the one thing the two of them silently, tacitly, never mentioned to each other.",

Not long ago, this was a battlefield where the village's guerrilla forces fought the invaders for control of the land. Sargon's colonial rule over Minos is now merely history, and the small invasion force has left this land that did not belong to them.\n'The brave archer repelled the enemy and became a hero admired far and wide. She also won the national archery championship. Then she returned to her hometown, settling into a life with her farm and garden... No, this ending is too bland. How can a tale of heroic adventure end so simply?'\nThe forest is quiet, and Erato's murmured storytelling is the only sound to be heard. The stiff bowstring vibrates, producing a faintly melodious sound. Several fowlbeasts settle in to form an audience, landing on the branches beside her, as well as her shoulders.\nErato looks south and sighs. The starlight above her head filters through layers of branches, leaving only a faint light. The vast sea of trees blocks the wind blowing in from the distance.\n'They say that the land beyond this forest is an endless desert. The invaders they expelled came from that desert.'\n'Life in places without grass and flowers must be difficult. But why is our world like this? Some places are full of flowers and grass, while others are barren?\n'Maybe the gods were lazy when shaping the lands, and in some places, they sculpted meticulously, creating mountains and lakes full of flowers and grass. In others, they just scribbled, resulting in desert and tundra. Because they live in such different environments, people in different places cannot understand each other, bringing about all manner of conflict... What do you think?'\nOf course, the fowlbeasts do not answer, they only take the flowers from Erato's hairpins and bring them back to their nests.\nErato proceeds with this opening, telling her story while playing and singing. From the hero leaving her hometown to the adventures on the road, meeting like-minded friends and teaching lessons to villains. By the time the story reaches 'The brave archer finally came to the place where the land ends and shot an arrow at the lazy creator god hiding there,' the last fowlbeast had fallen asleep by her side.\nErato jumps down from the tree branch and lands on the soft grass.\n'I should go and see for myself. Maybe I can find a similar story in my travels.'",

        "description": "An Engineering operator, his beard slightly white, handed me my custom-order set of casting equipment. Its appearance was exactly as I'd requested: a simple metal case with not a hint of adornment, a wand with the surface polished to a mirror sheen, and a spherical energy reserve unit in a full silver color. Freshly produced, the Originium circuitry gave off the smell of solvent.\nI picked up the wand from the case, and the reserve smoothly floated up with it, responding to the wand's movements, resting into a stable orbit in the air some thirty or forty centimeters from my hand.\nI fired the reserve out, and the red circle bullseye at the center of the alloy was dented inwards by it. Impeccable energy conversion efficiency.\nThe Engineering operator's and my expressions were in total accord. We understood what a masterpiece this was.\n\nSome months later, I met him again, bringing my old wand with me, and some Originium dice in my pocket.\n'Old shoes do fit easier,' he remarked.\nI could only shrug.\n'Still, I'd like to know why you went back to your old equipment,' he said, his gaze sharp behind his goggles. 'Even if it's just cosmetic reasons—no skin off my nose. Call it a little after-sales service courtesy of Engineering.'\n'Because of... the noise.'\n'Noise?'\nI simply pulled out my wand and give it a perfunctory wave. The tip streaked through the air, but what came was not the sound of slicing air, but music.\n'I did some research into your wand there, when we got your request. The frequencies it vibrates against the air at are beyond common sense, I can tell you that. It's a real mystery, but it doesn't do anything to help casting. Doesn't hinder either, though.'\n'I understand, but this ties to my—'\nMy personal affairs.\nI ordered the wand precisely to distance myself from that bothersome music. It and the fantastical melody that once played at the Afterglow Hall are all but the same. For each day that I use the wand, that night I dream of that scene again, and hear that melody.\nThe new wand successfully quietened my dreams, but the scene still laid before me, the silent struggle all the more wretched, the silent death throes all the more terrible.\nOnly once I took up my old wand again did I understand. That nightmare would run its way through my entire life—had already done so—and to try and forget was mere futility.\nI couldn't flee it, and couldn't reconcile with it either. I was forced to concede that it was a part of me, and that I would fight it for the rest of my days.\nAs now well demonstrated. I was the one who ordered the wand, and the one who gave up on it.\nGraf Urtica simply walked away from it all, and left all the trouble and anger to others, but Ebenholz could not.\nOf course, Ebenholz could denounce those morons who thought themselves so lofty; however, faced with a craftsman who he'd offended, did he truly have the right to send them packing with but a few vile words?\nIf it were... him, what would he do? What would he want me to do?\nThe answer couldn't be any clearer.\nWith difficulty, I cleared my throat, unsure if I would offend the craftsman once again with this.\n'The story is a little long, but... if you're willing to listen, I can explain in full detail.'",

The blueprint for the completed thing is her own design, down to the types and itty-bitty details of the parts, but the whole thing was entrusted to the mentor Astgenne trusted most.\nIt was meant for Astesia to personally give to Astgenne at their birthday party, but the silly girl hasn't celebrated her birthday at home in ages.\nSo she waits, for the right moment.\nAnd in the end, she gifts it to Astgenne as a farewell present, the day she sends her off to university. She knows Astgenne is bound to like it.\n\nElena likes it indeed, and would love to assemble it. But looking at this pile of fragments, each a piece of art, she's struck by the feeling that she shouldn't complete it on her own.\nShe needs to find some free time—and take up a little of her older sister's—when they can assemble it together.\n...Or so she intends. She makes a note to herself on her pad before diving headfirst into her endless university courses and projects.\nIt's always on her mind, always. Every time she meets her sister, Astgenne wants to yank her over to the dorms, so they can complete the gift she gave her together.\nBut she blinks, and deadline for her thesis, and the requisites for her defense, and the pressure of her projects all loom, sucking away all her spare time. Every time she thinks of it, the crush of reality suppresses her urge.\nSome desires are untempered by time, but life and work are more than capable of postponing the realization of a wish, indefinitely\n.......\nOwing to some circumstances, she's now been sent out by Rhine Lab and become a Rhodes Island Operator. Her Rhine Lab colleagues helped her pack everything, and she now stands in her brand new vacuum of a room, unpacking that minor mountain of personal belongings and experimental equipment, bit by bit.\nShe finds a box laden with dust, and those dolts back at the lab didn't even pack her a dusting cloth. With no better option, she sounds the bell on the dorm room next door, first to say hi to her new neighbor, and second to borrow a rag to wipe off the dust.\nThe door opens.\nAnd there's Astesia, who stuffs clean wet wipes and an all-purpose toolbox into her dumbstruck little sister's hands.\n......\nOne wonders if perhaps, after the sisters have finished sorting out the room, that's the sound of a clock we can hear.",

        "description": "Deszcz's 'The Conflict, Reconciliation, and Imagined Future of Kazimierz's Present Legislature with Regards to Trade Capital' is an incisively opined piece, fully and flawlessly expounded on, and combines depth of theory with practical value. It is, with no room for doubt, a superlatively written essay. But conferring on her the law school's honor of Outstanding Graduate was a decision I had to vie with some other teachers over.\nHaving taught for decades, we often see students with aspiration in their hearts, their hands faintly trembling against the cover of the Code they swear their oath on, their anticipation and resolution a burning light in their eyes. We also often see students who change course or lose their bearings midway; they ask why a prompt as absurd as 'A thief lacerates a victim's arm intending to intimidate; however, the victim suffers from aplastic anemia and soon passes away from blood loss. What criminal charges and sentencing would be appropriate?' would appear on the bar exam, and soon after are taken aback to find that in Kazimierz, what one learns, what is tested, and what one uses all stand completely on their own. Every clause in the code is well-defined yet unfortunately narrow, and cannot keep pace with the speed at which the arena and the commercial streets develop. The dispute between 'the means justify the ends' and 'the ends justify the means' exists only in the classroom, and in reality, practical law is much more dependent on interpretation, supplementation, and guidance by precedent-setting cases... its form in a vacuum being the true face of Kazimierz law. It's not an easy pill to swallow for us old-timers, to say nothing of the youth.\nDeszcz is a reasonably excellent student. I once advised her to remain at the school to further her studies; perhaps the additional knowledge and dialectical thought would polish her acute mind to possess greater wisdom. However, she was all but itching to unleash her ferocity in true combat. She'd already obtained a formal job offer from the Longrein Law Firm prior to writing this thesis. Before she went into the field, I went and greeted the fine lawyer who took her on, begging him to take care of this student did not yet understand a thing. But he said Deszcz had 'adapted' very well to the firm, had suggested a number of improvements that hit the nail on the head, and spurred headway on their lawsuits, so he exhorted me not to worry too much.\nDeszcz is too clever, and too uncompromising—this is the greatest thing separating her from most students. Her dedication to using law to seek the truth has supported her in achieving such excellent grades, but she has yet to prepare herself for 'being unable to find an answer.' As we all know, the more devout the believer, the more susceptible they are to falling into an even deeper emptiness when that belief crumbles. As teachers, we have no right to choose our students' paths forward. We can only be there behind them, to send them off and wish them well.\nIt's my hope that she doesn't become simply the next youth to lose their way amidst the Grand Knight Territory's resplendent neons.\n......\n\n—Extracted from a speech made by Deszcz's mentor, Professor Łobacz, at the internal evaluation conference for the school's Outstanding Graduates",

        "description": "Nothing could be more stupid than having to name your own weapon, Texas thinks, staring at the form in front of her.\nNuova Volsinii forbids the carrying of weapons, even hidden ones, but Penguin Logistics is without a doubt a special case. Hence, their need to file a little additional registration. It doesn't mean they can use weapons in urban areas, but simply that under certain circumstances, their weapons will be returned to them.\nWhich is not to say she has to go through something as dumb as weapon NAMING, of course, it's just—she sees Exusiai elatedly wracking the ol' noggin and filling in names she came up with a second ago for each one of her guns, and she catches the gaze Exusiai throws her way from time to time— appreciation mixed with eagerness—and she knows that if she doesn't do it herself, Exusiai will snatch away her paperwork and give her two new swords names so stupid you'd call them groundbreaking.\nShe really can't say she's all that invested in these blades, given that she only reluctantly accepted them as a gift in the first place. Frankly, she's not even the type to get hung up on this stuff—if the swords she'd been using before weren't of fairly unique make, she'd probably have changed weapons several times over by now.\nMoreover, the maker of these twin swords was doubtlessly trying to draw some sort of... spiritual thing from the story of the Texas family name, which was then affixed squarely on top. And despite the fact that it made even more headache for her, it led even the official inspecting her weapons to cast her an expectant look, as if to say 'surely, arms such as these must have wonderful names.'\nThe door opens with a groan, and in come Sora and Croissant toting bags of all sizes. Their new base is in dire need of dressing up, and the two of them have always been on decor duty.\n'Oh my gosh, Texas, you've been sitting there for three hours,' Sora can't help but exclaim when she finds, after moving to Texas's side, that the form is still in the exact same shape as when she left.\nTexas gives a shrug of the shoulders, hands the pen to her, and makes it clear: Texas is checked out.\n'I'm busy sorting out the base! I can't help you with this,' Sora says, mouth curling to one side. 'Besides, it's not like this family stuff has anything to do with me—I'm just some performer.'\nTexas rolls her eyes. She'd finally laid out her whole past to her friends, and now it was nothing more than a harmless joke between them. She shoots a look at Croissant, but the Forte raises her hands as if to say she's all tied up herself. Still, something seems to hit her immediately after, and she pulls something out of a bag and slings it to Texas.\n'Bought it on the way. Think it over nice 'n slow, now—ya got plenty time 'n all.'\nTexas catches it, looks down, and finds it's a box of chocolates.\nHaving said her piece, Croissant heads into the kitchen. She's bought a bumper crop of cookware, and tonight will be her first time flexing her skills in Nuova Volsinii.\nSora switches a new record onto the gramophone. Melodious music fills the new base, while she begins to read the script she has in hand. She's gotten a new job, no doubt.\nExusiai's battle with her forms seems to be nearing a close, and one look at her face tells you she's pretty damn satisfied with what she's accomplished, but Texas knows the next time she fetches her weapons, she's not going to remember a single one of the names she thought up here.\nThis is my life now.\nTexas tears open the packaging, pulls out a stick and begins to slowly chew on it, but the feel of the chocolate as it gradually melts in her mouth, on top of everything she sees and hears and senses right now, leads to a moment of inspiration.\nShe promptly puts pen to form, fills in the name 'Blueberry & Dark Chocolate' a few times before tossing the pen aside.\nExusiai leans in to steal a glance, and bluntly tells her, 'I gotta say, partner, those are <<i>>really</i> stupid names.'\n'I agree.' Texas leans back in her office chair, gives her body a stretch, and puts her earphones on. 'But that's just the right amount of stupid.'",

Lunacub has her own dormitory (even if she's not often indoors), and camping on the deck violates Rhodes Island safety and firefighting regulations, but still she assiduously avoids patrols, setting up her tent on the deck again and again, always somewhere where she can get a clear view of the sky.\nThe tent was built by Lunacub herself, although 'built' might not be the best word: it moreso resembles fabric pieced together into one, then propped up as best she can so the wasteland gales don't blow it down so easily. What's noteworthy is where the fabric originates—\nFollowing Lunacub's eleventh time this quarter attempting to sneak into the warehouse and tripping the security system, Rhodes Island HR had a thorough conversation with her, and found in her possession several unregistered Rhodes Island uniforms (parts of which were shorn off and sewn into her tent). Lunacub's manners were impeccable during the conversation, expressing that she was 'just passing by,' and that 'on the outside, you can take stuff if nobody's watching it.' HR rectified the lapse in Lunacub's understanding, reiterated Rhodes Island discipline, as well as inquired as to where certain other parts of the tent fabric had come from.\n'The grey cloth? I found it in the forest. It was hanging on a tree. I pulled it down.'\n'This one's really warm, so it's really useful when it snows. I found it too, buried in a hole. Agnese told me about it.'\n'This one's amazing, it stops water! Someone gave it to me. I know what that look is—really, he did! I gave him directions, and he said it was payment!'\n'No, this isn't... um, these clothes are okay because they went through proceedings? You said something about application proceedings—how do you do that?'\n'This pelt is my friend's. I miss her a lot.'\nLunacub declined HR's proposal to provide her with a standard-issue Rhodes Island tent.",

Holds a firm and aggressive stance towards people of Taran background. He is on high alert, and decapitation operations are not advised.\nOn the evening of the 12th, he dined with two Messengers at the Waterside Restaurant, lip reading reveals that they were dispatched by a certain Count.\n...\nAs expected, all attempts at communication have failed. It can now be confirmed that the Oripathy crisis in County Hillock has been artificially exacerbated. Someone is stoking his hatred behind the scenes and using his stubborn and self-centered personality to test the Duke of Wellington's stance. The battle plan has taken shape, and the image contains a telegram sent to the barracks on an outlying plate.\nThis calls for a requisite disclosure of information to him in order to reduce suspicion on me from within the military apparatus.\n\nPersonnel: Count Mourning\nIntends to defect to the Duke of Wellington. His demesne is near to Londinium, and a large quantity of Originium product orders have been flowing in. Based on the volume, he has the military prowess to stand firm against the various units outside Londinium.\nHe and his wife share a love of Bolívarian coffee, taking regular trips to purchase the beans in person. His children are not yet of age, and his eldest daughter attended a private secondary school in the Auchterigg Borough of Londinium until departing last year.\nSignature and handwriting can be seen in the image.\n...\nHe is on good terms with the Skamandros family, and most of his trusted aides also have respect for the White Wolf Count. Rita may be a crucial bargaining chip. If Mandragora brings Rita with her to negotiate a collaboration, the process should go smoother. After all, he would not want to see anything happen to his friend's daughter. Time is limited, we will need to push him to make a decision and agree to help Dublinn infiltrate Londinium.\n\nOrganization: 'Rhodes Island'\nThe medical organization that made off with Loughshinny. They're registered in Victoria and have four drug patents pertaining to Oripathy.\n...\n\n'The remaining pages are all about you, so you've no need to scrutinize them any further, right?'\n'I've been at it for nearly a year now, and this is the only information I've gathered. I have to compliment your clandestine work.'\n'The intelligence I'm offering you is only the lovingly curated fraction that is beneficial to the both of us. Whether or not I've fabricated anything is up to you to determine.'\n'...Come now, have I not been sufficiently pacifist in my methods?'\n'After all, I've never picked anyone out as an enemy, and I don't particularly enjoy seeing people sacrifice themselves.'\n'I just like to push people in the right direction and listen as those contradictory bits form their own harmony.'",
